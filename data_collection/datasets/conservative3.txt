Can I join if i'm not a conservative, just done with liberals?<END_COMMENT>
R/conservatives, for when you are terrified of the public being able to post to your content.<END_COMMENT>
Let's goooooo<END_COMMENT>
10/10 would recommend<END_COMMENT>
We do not have the same limitations as on Reddit, so people of all political beliefs are welcome to the Discord. There are private areas only for verified conservatives as well (if you have flair here just PM a Discord moderator to get into them).<END_COMMENT>
r/Republicans is good too<END_COMMENT>
[deleted]<END_COMMENT>
Yes<END_COMMENT>
Interestingly enough,  I've been banned from a number of the major subreddits due to their fear of having opposing viewpoints<END_COMMENT>
Absolutely also best flair good job<END_COMMENT>
Yea!!!<END_COMMENT>

I am not even American, but would like to immigrate to the U.S. (legally, of course), and agree with your suggestion<END_COMMENT>
Jesus that second sub is cancer. Not sure how that isn't considered hate. Even more not sure why I looked there.<END_COMMENT>
Show proof or gtfo. This is the stupidest thing lefties believe. That the right (conservatives) supports genocide. You are delusional. Get help.<END_COMMENT>
Hell yeah! We have been in war in the Middle East for almost my entire life. Bring 'em home!!!<END_COMMENT>
I've never seen the left turn pro-endless wars so quickly.<END_COMMENT>
No fan of Trump but if this is true, well done.<END_COMMENT>
I can't wait to see (if he wins) Biden's excuse as to why we need to go back to Afghanistan.<END_COMMENT>
The pull out method has always worked for me<END_COMMENT>
Not our country, not our problem.  We came for Bin Laden, we got Bin Laden.  Time to roll out.  Maybe help the 80,000 homeless people in California.<END_COMMENT>

CNN; *How ending wars fuels white supremacy*<END_COMMENT>
Funny how democrats who for 30 years have wanted this are against it all the sudden<END_COMMENT>
I'm sure the war drums will start beating again once the swamp is back in the white house. If they keep us scared and mad at poor brown people in distant lands, we won't have our focus on what they're doing to us.<END_COMMENT>
Why now and not 4 years ago? or 3 years ago? or 2?<END_COMMENT>
If Trump loses in court and Biden takes over. I give it less than year before those troops turn right back around and are back in Afghanistan.<END_COMMENT>
This is one of two reasons I voted for Trump. These forever wars have to end. No benefit whatsoever from our presence there.<END_COMMENT>
should be easy as he has 4 more years<END_COMMENT>
Many of the soldiers deployed there were not even alive when the towers fell.<END_COMMENT>
We've been there all of mine...<END_COMMENT>
Withdrawal from the Middle East (correction: and Central Asia) is definitely a good thing, but it should be remembered that a withdrawal after war without stabilizing the region sufficiently usually leads to more unrest (and is part of what started all this).<END_COMMENT>
[removed]<END_COMMENT>
Remember obamas 8 yrs ? So much conflict drone strikes etc<END_COMMENT>
I'm on the left, and this is one thing I'm actually happy to see. I also liked some of the things I read in the NAFTA agreement (or whatever he rebranded it as.) Orange man definitely still bad, but I can be happy when policies I like are put in place. This isn't football, I don't care who is winning so long as what I want is being done.<END_COMMENT>
When do you think conservatives will start caring about the debt and deficit or morals again?<END_COMMENT>
If he does, there will be over 400 electoral red votes.<END_COMMENT>
I am not sure when the GOP became the party to want troop withdrawal (it sure wasn't when Obama was president), but I'm sure hoping you'll keep this perspective in future administrations.<END_COMMENT>
Why did he wait until his last year in office to do this?<END_COMMENT>
Honestly, if the left would've just worked with him, I'm sure some good stuff would get done. He's not as far right as the left seems to be. But the left just had to demonize him. I hope the guy gets another 4 years, but it seems bleak at this point.<END_COMMENT>
Biden ends racism by sending troops back to mostly peaceful war in Afghanistan.<END_COMMENT>
Not all of us.  I'll applaud him if he actually does it.  I was disappointed when Obama did not manage it.  And I have no hopes Biden will do it.<END_COMMENT>
But you forget, there was a virus unleashed by China and riots caused by the lockdowns that Trump was against. If he just never used twitter everything would be fine.<END_COMMENT>
They've proven they're just as good at making us afraid of each other. Suddenly literally every person on the street is a potential murderer.<END_COMMENT>
And he already pulled out of some campaigns and made peace deals<END_COMMENT>
I still remember being woke up and told to stand to. We were brought into the rec room with the TV on the news, middle of the night in Okinawa, and most of us initially thought it was just a movie someone had on...<END_COMMENT>
There are no solutions in these situations, only tradeoffs.  There will be problems with any decision (or lack of decision) so we just have to look at the whole picture and decide if we are cool with it.<END_COMMENT>
ITS BEEN ALMOST 20 FUCKING YEARS, ITS TIME TO MOVE ON.<END_COMMENT>
What is the likelihood we can stabalize the region, regardless of how long it takes? The region has been at war for literal millenia.<END_COMMENT>
I think the US should announce a willingness to pull out and put it to a vote to the country they're in? If people don't want them there, pull out. If things get messy then it's their fault? Haha. Obviously not an airtight plan but maybe the groundwork for one?<END_COMMENT>
Yeah. "Stabilize the region". What does that mean exactly?<END_COMMENT>
Not our problem. Time for us to stop playing world police. Let these shitholes burn to the ground under their own leaderships<END_COMMENT>
Same excuse is always made for a withdrawal.<END_COMMENT>
Obama/Clinton/ France's "Humanitarian intervention" into Libya which destroyed the most stable, educated, and healthy country in Africa and replaced it with extremism, civil war, and slavery. Obama didn't ever care for a minute about Libyans.<END_COMMENT>
That's true tbh.<END_COMMENT>
Doubt it. Media will paint this differently<END_COMMENT>
I can kinda sorta see a benefit to squashing stuff as it pops up before it turns into a bigger problem (ISIS) but there are people in Afghanistan that weren't even alive in 2001. No more long draw out conflicts, the military should only be engaged with a clear victory condition and then it should be unleashed at it's full capacity, no holds barred. If it's not bad enough to do that, it's not bad enough to get involved.<END_COMMENT>
For reals. I mean, I'm fairly liberal, but fuck, isn't this what we wanted? An end to the endless wars? Sign me up.<END_COMMENT>
He had the Senate for 4 years, what difference would that have made.  He's a moron.<END_COMMENT>
Trump isn't even close to republican, yet the left keeps saying that. Trump is in the middle, he hasn't been in politics for 20yrs+, he is the type of candidate this country needed. The left complained about voting is old white politicians, so they voted in Biden so we can have more of the same that they didn't want? I DONT GET IT!!<END_COMMENT>
I didnt know going to court for a case of voter fraud is being an authoritarian dictator<END_COMMENT>
Not even. Biden voters have nothing but disdain for people of color that vote Republican or lean right. Racial equality only matters when their brown/black skin pets are on their side. People on the left and even some losers on our side didnt vote for Trump because of his "abrasive personality." Dumbest thing ever. This is coming from a person of color btw.<END_COMMENT>
You mean like every Trump supporter is a Nazi and every Democrat is a violent Marxist?<END_COMMENT>
Exactly. Cut your losses and get out.<END_COMMENT>
Spend American lives and tax dollars to enrich the military industrial complex, their lobbyists, and their pet congresscreatures.<END_COMMENT>
Except it very much is NOT his fault in this instance and IS someone else's fault. Or are you just choosing to ignore that?<END_COMMENT>
You think terrorists give a shit about peace agreements? As long as the people in those areas dont want to govern themselves, it's going to be the same shithole its been for a couple hundred years. Pull them all out now it's a total waste of life and time.<END_COMMENT>

The main losers in all this will be the Khurds who will be completely slaughtered. I don't trust Russia to have any sort of positive influence in the region considering their track record in Afghanistan and Syria more recently. People are going to die no matter what happens there. There isn't an easy answer but American boots on the ground certainly aren't helping! We just need to come down hard on Russia, Iran, or Syria when they inevitably step in and start stirring up tensions again.<END_COMMENT>
Don't need to watch Alex Jones to see his gafs, glazed over eyes, and groping children.<END_COMMENT>
The EU block is heavily against Trump, he is on "War" with China, so what's left is Putin? I mean maybe i miss something, but i think Trump has not done a lot of good with US allies. What's your opinion on this one?<END_COMMENT>
Yeah ill talk to you in 2 months buddy lmfao<END_COMMENT>
The terror groups are their because of US intervention. Just leaving and securing the US border is all that is necessary to do.<END_COMMENT>
Haha exactly, I'm subbed to politics and Conservative as well. I now hate both parties vehemently. Shows you how much, even when aware of it, media does have an influence on you.<END_COMMENT>
So why tariff the fuck out of all your friends? You know the trade deficit with China has gone up right? The only solution is a trade embargos and the like.<END_COMMENT>
"Honey I arrested the suspect!"<END_COMMENT>
Looks like a case of the Knockout Game to me.<END_COMMENT>
It takes someone famous for someone to be arrested, but if you're an average Joe walking to your hotel and being redirected into the vicious mob, you don't even get a second thought.<END_COMMENT>
If there was one thing that would actually unite the country it would be this.<END_COMMENT>
Welp I'm glad the guy was arrested but [there is much more](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8952137/Two-robbers-beat-boy-14-broad-daylight-against-scaffolding-order-steal-jacket-bag.html) where that came from.<END_COMMENT>
I commend him for concentrating on raising his kids, but why the F in NYC? Oh wait, wasn't Giuliani the mayor then...<END_COMMENT>
Knockout game is usually played with a group of jogging enthusiasts, this looks to just be a lone pyschopath.<END_COMMENT>
Well, to be fair he did this to another couple and got arrested for it. He's a violent offender with 5 felonies and 12 arrests, he shouldn't have been released for the violent crimes he committed before the Moranis incident.<END_COMMENT>
God I hate the media.  The attack wasn't alleged - it was documented.  The identity of the attacker is alleged, not the attack itself.  Did these fucking morons finish middle school before becoming journalists?  Can they understand the words they write?<END_COMMENT>
I'm all for Moranis being strong and pressing charges. But what the fuck does it have to with him being white?<END_COMMENT>
Doubtful but the guy has had a tough life dealing with his wife die of cancer.<END_COMMENT>
It is a post-riot phenomenon and a so-called "hate crime" that is not being addressed. Whites are being assaulted in this way in multiple instances which have been caught on tape. Who knows how many there have actually been. They receive little press and there is no will, or outrage, to prosecute - just like all of the other no-bail/no-jail crimes being ignored that rioters committed. The reason this got coverage is because he's a celebrity. Law and order is a conservative position, especially not "defunding" police or disregarding crimes committed due to the race of the perpetrator.<END_COMMENT>
Well they care when white people kill black people - as we know that never happens the other direction<END_COMMENT>
"Alleged" is the media's CYA word so they can't get sued.  Particularly if it comes out that there was a hoax/coverup surrounding whatever news piece they were covering.<END_COMMENT>
The guy who did it was black, so somehow that's related to BLM and whatnot<END_COMMENT>
Also it's a black thing.  Not to say that people from all races don't play but it originated in the black community.<END_COMMENT>

This needs to be upvoted excessively. It is almost impossible to understate how important the 1st Amendment (in its current form) is to freedom of debate, criticism, etc in this country. I know people who left communist countries and were thrilled when they could come here and speak openly about whatever they wanted to. Stuff like this scares the living daylights out of them (and me).<END_COMMENT>
The First Amendment isn't flawed. This bullshit logic is flawed. I hope this article is either shenanigans or wishful thinking. If not, It's our duty as Americans to take up arms and occupy the streets to abolish this evil within our nation.<END_COMMENT>

I honestly would. He's a pretty moderate candidate as a person, and doesn't really know what he, as a politician, believes. His own website contradicts things he said in the debates. But in general, he's pretty Left-Center. Kamala, on the other hand, is a a complete Socialist Left who's going to destroy the country and its very sad people voted for Biden because "Orange Man Bad" as opposed to policy. Hers being that she's going to destroy the country when she's president(assuming Dems end up stealing the election)<END_COMMENT>
Just browsing through that list it's incredible to me than any 2A supporters voted for him, but I know they're out there.<END_COMMENT>

If 0.004% survival rate is true and there are 300 million in the US, if everyone got covid, then there would be 12,000 deaths. I'm seeing 250k deaths with 12 million cases. So what gives?<END_COMMENT>
You don't want your cells invaded by mRNA to reprogram them to produce the COVID spike proteins so your immune system can detect it?<END_COMMENT>
My god. r/conspiracy is leaking.<END_COMMENT>
The thing is, it's also an easier vaccine to distribute and doesn't require as low temperatures as the other one.<END_COMMENT>
Wallstreet won't care. General public won't care. Bigger number = better number. Even having a stupidly low sample size won't matter. Moderna is up 6.2% today (as of me writing this).<END_COMMENT>

So when you 'did a little research', you didn't realise that the figure is more like 99.6 not 99.996?... maybe work on your research skills. You and everyone that updated you are complete clowns.<END_COMMENT>

I'm just happy to see a heavy divide in their own party. Many don't want super radical progressivness. I also hope they give Pelosi the boot<END_COMMENT>

[ungated](https://archive.is/81I5K)<END_COMMENT>
I mean, there's a divide in the Conservative party, too. Dems lost seats in the House but Biden is winning the election because people are voting against Trump, not because they're voting *for* Biden. I fully expect many flipped states will flip back in 4 years if the GOP puts forth a less divisive candidate. No one who voted for Trump is suddenly going to vote against the GOP just because Trump isn't their candidate, and all those people who voted blue for President but red for Reps are going to go back to voting red for President too.<END_COMMENT>
The progressives actually did better among the Democrats running. If your hope is for more "moderate" Democrats you should be cheering for Pelosi and the old guard. If you think Pelosi is "radical progressive" than you are in for a shock when you actually see what hard left actually looks like.<END_COMMENT>
America is more progressive than people think. You can see it in all of the progressive ballot initiatives that passed. Liberal politicians are garbage and don't actual care about their constituents. They offer half assed policies than only piss off both sides. They say dumb things like Defund the Police instead of Police Reform. Liberals are simply bad at their job in comparison to their conservative counterparts.<END_COMMENT>
To be fair... Could they have moved forward on big government promises without a blue senate?<END_COMMENT>
This. Atleast Bernie and AOC are consistent in their beliefs, like them or not. The rest of the DNC is a loaded with opinion shifting talkNoWalkers. Its the one reason i personally dont like Kamala. She was the main one hsing the dnc primaries as a means to just call out everyone, and now her and Joe are childhood friends. Fuck the 2 party system.<END_COMMENT>
No. A red senate will always tie dems hands behind their back then blame them for not executing.<END_COMMENT>
Ah, the myth of the "low information voter". People tend to be knowledgeable on subjects that most directly impact them. While the average midwestern farmer living in a homogoneous town may not be well versed in critical race theory, the average Berkeley grad living in a diverse metropolitan area is probably not going to be well versed in agricultural microeconomics. It's almost universally true that people do not want to vote against their best interests. I think it's irresponsible to shame someone as "contributing to marginalization" when they are simply doing what they think best for their community.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah, if the party does split it would go 3 ways. The far left (Bernie AOC warren etc), the moderates (Gabbard ) who would probably join a more reformed/economically liberal socially conservative Republican Party. And then the career politicians would remain on the democrat party like Biden/Harris/Booker/DeBlausio/Pelosi etc<END_COMMENT>

Was in DC yesterday. Was unaware of what was going on (cuz read my username). Was wild to see the city like that. Fences blocking areas that should be enjoyed. HUGE numbers of boarded up businesses. Very sad to see our nations capitol reduced to this because of the alt left<END_COMMENT>
Terrorists tbh<END_COMMENT>
Holy crap I knew it was going on but I've been off of Facebook and liberal subs for a year or so, until I saw a post on r/publicfreakout earlier with a proud boy punching someone. The comment section was totally disgusting. They truly believe they are on the right side of history and Trump supporters just need to be eradicated.<END_COMMENT>
Dumbasses eat it up though. And commit violent acts, believing themselves to be freedom fighters. It will continue if their propaganda is not countered at every turn<END_COMMENT>
I've seen enough old people getting beat up that there is a small, maybe immature, side of me that wants to get involved. I've never seen so many scum bags that need corralled.<END_COMMENT>
Yep. We already know what it is<END_COMMENT>
He's charged with assault with a deadly weapon. That is a serious crime. If they get no bail and probation for that you're going to see frontier justice return to American cities.<END_COMMENT>
The left was all about female empowerment, but imagine how many women and girls got molested and raped since Floyd riots started? Especially inside CHAD, but also around the country with the overall increase in thug activity, and on the fringes of the riots. What happens when 2-3 overly agressive retards notice a girl walking across the street?<END_COMMENT>
Leftists always ask me how I know "it was antifa", and I always say "oh, you can immediately tell" because its true. They all have that malnourished soyboy look.<END_COMMENT>
What are you talking about<END_COMMENT>
Lmao 1 example and it's from the Proud Boys, not the average conservative....now let's talk about what the average leftist is doing at the riots.<END_COMMENT>
BTW since you went and cried about this sub not allowing the average yuppy to comment, do you understand why conservative subs have that rule in place? Because all you pussy hurt liberals come in here to cry and brigade every time Trump does something, every time a conservative does something, every time a liberal does something, every time BLM does something, etc. You idiots can't stay in your own subs but you flip shit and scream racism every time a conservative even peeks in left leaning subs.<END_COMMENT>
Loooooooooooooooool sure there bud<END_COMMENT>

The [Great Barrington Proclamation](https://gbdeclaration.org/view-signatures/) which opposes general lockdowns and favors focused protection now has 12,002 medical and public health care scientists supporting it, and 34,663 medical practitioners supporting it. How many medical professionals signing onto it will it take before focused protection is acknowledged as best practice?<END_COMMENT>
They're going to do this to us until every small business is destroyed and we're begging for socialism if they'll just stop it.<END_COMMENT>
This is what great reset looks like<END_COMMENT>
Rand is right.  These lockdowns are getting beyond farcical.  Why are we locking down the entire country when this virus primarily targets the elderly?  Why should everyone else have to have their entire lives disrupted?  Can't we just quarantine the elderly and let everyone else get on with their lives?<END_COMMENT>

Oregon just killed my job for a 2nd time in a year and just put my friends restaurant out of business. Good job kate brown<END_COMMENT>
I think its just a plot to bankrupt the middle class. They've been after that goal for decades.<END_COMMENT>
You think it's some kind of left-conspiracy to destroy small business? Interesting take on the pandemic.<END_COMMENT>
That's what they said for the first lockdown...<END_COMMENT>
I live in PA and I believe they found Wolf's lockdowns unconstitutional in a court case that he lost. I can tell you that where I live, most business won't stand another lockdown.<END_COMMENT>
Not at all, I'm a patriot. Im sick of it all.<END_COMMENT>
Never let a crisis go to waste.  The virus has provided a convenient excuse for politicians to expand their power and government overreach, all in the name of "emergency powers".<END_COMMENT>
I work from home so it hasn't really affected me other than having to wear a mask to get groceries once or twice a week. What bothers me most is how easy some Governors found it to trample civil liberties. Even when State Supreme Courts ruled against their actions.<END_COMMENT>
I'm a restaurant cook. I don't want another vacation, working again has been good for my mental health, I need to stay busy and I like earning my own living, not getting government hand outs. If my state locks down again, I'm done with this industry. I'll get a job that the government can't shut down.<END_COMMENT>
Oh boy, i for-see scary dark times if that plan is followed.<END_COMMENT>
So have you found a government job yet ? If the tyrants get the election, the lockdown 2.0  will happen.<END_COMMENT>
They have been pushing it the entire time during covid saying this is the perfect time for it to happen.<END_COMMENT>
Why are you dodging his question? Do you believe this pandemic is a conspiracy to destroy small businesses?<END_COMMENT>
Well I was thinking a grocery store, warehouse or factory job would be where I start. My ex works at a vitamin packaging plant and even they got the "essential business" pass. Its all so stupid.<END_COMMENT>
Covid did what climate alarm alone couldn't do imo.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah it all goes together I think.  Make young kids feel guilty for the environment and living in privilege.  Demoralize them by trashing the economy with lockdowns and covid.  Say we need to change for a fairer, better world. They agree.  The ones that will have it the most "fair" will be the technocrats that stay on top and run everything. Like animal farm. Some animals are more equal than others.<END_COMMENT>
The Obamas are all media hype and little substance<END_COMMENT>

And while Biden is saying "there is a time to heal" (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8) other democrats are calling to "essentially, burn down the Republican Party" - Jennifer Rubin.<END_COMMENT>
For the last four years we have been called racists, homophobs, cheaters, nazis,and every other name they can think of. Now that they think they have the Whitehouse Biden and Harris are calling for unity? I don't think so. Not while your party has yet to denounce the antifa and blm attacks and violence, not while the Dems have called for making a list of trump supporters so they can interrupt our lives, and not while your party continues to fight to remove our God given rights. You see we believe that we have rights and the constitution doesn't give us those rights it just affirms the rights we have.<END_COMMENT>
We will not compromise our values and let the leftists walk all over us. We have our rights and freedoms and we deserve to make our own choices.<END_COMMENT>
Never offer unity to people who wouldn't consider offering it to you in return.<END_COMMENT>
No unity. No surrender. Trump has handed the Republican party it's spine back. Use it or lose it.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah lets sweep all the illegal corruption and evidence of election tampering under the rug, hug it out while terrorist beat you with bricks and chains, hold hands while your rights get dissolved and happily sing together as the country's economy tanks... you'll just have to stay home while jobs, service and products disappear because covid but they'll all be flying private their private jets and having parties to celebrate "our" unity.<END_COMMENT>
Speaking of gas lighting....where, *exactly*, is the "Office of the President Elect"?  Is that in Washington DC?  Scranton?<END_COMMENT>

Bullshit. He wanted the count stopped because Republican poll watchers weren't allowed to see what was going on. But please, keep drinking that MSM Kool-aid.<END_COMMENT>
You do realize the Dems tried to pass a law in states to prevent Republican party members from being part of the vote-counting process. Thankfully it didn't pass.<END_COMMENT>

Way fox is killing it's viewership, trump could pick it up at fire sale prices and hannity and tucker wont even have to change their badges lol. Then buy newsmax also.<END_COMMENT>

Does anyone, really? I watched the 60 minutes last night and listened to Obummer for 8 years. He rarely actually says anything. Word salad. Word vomit. Very little of substance. Trump lives rent free in Obummers head. He never talks about his administration, just garbles things about Trump that make no sense<END_COMMENT>

Other countries have been socialists for generations, they have raised a generation of people ready to listen to their nanny states and dutifully fall in line when they command so. These other countries, despite their shutdowns, have not fixed a thing about the virus. The virus is back while they continue to destroy their economies. Not very smart.  Trump is right when he said that the virus cure cannot be worse than the problems itself. The leftists in high places don't understand this simple concept. They are incompetent fools.<END_COMMENT>

Asians, I welcome you to the white category.<END_COMMENT>
Here's an idea: instead of race baiting with identity politics, why not just label the category impoverished or underprivileged students that can include those of any skin color or background... You know, have subsidies based on someone's actual need rather than having such benefits based on the color of someone's skin.<END_COMMENT>
Welcome Asians you can now oppress the minorities with us<END_COMMENT>
This stuff is bullshittery. Race classifications should just be ignored entirely.<END_COMMENT>

We've never had the luxury of benefitting from affirmative action, etc etc... So I'm all for it! Maybe we can take away the *actually racist* "students of color" and experience some true equality! But that wouldn't fit the popular leftist agenda now would it...<END_COMMENT>
This is actually good news for me. As a white supremacist, I have subjected myself to self-harm for years over my attraction to Cuban women.  No more cutting myself secretly! Cuban womenz is white now.<END_COMMENT>

In America "Asian" means East Asian or Southeast Asian. If you want to indicate Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi people you would need to specify South Asian.<END_COMMENT>
And students will also declare their religions<END_COMMENT>
They're not a minority because they don't fit into the helpless victim category that leftists like to create.<END_COMMENT>
I would say that it is because both East Asians and South Asians are extremely successful in the U.S. compared to other groups.<END_COMMENT>

That's not necessarily true, many Americans use Asian to refer to people from all over Asia, India obviously included.<END_COMMENT>

For a man living in Europe it's so weird reading about all this obsession with colours in us and the thing that only certain "race" has the right to be called with a certain colour.

I've lived in several regions and I haven't found that to be the case at all. Asians are almost exclusively people who look like Chinese/Japanese/Korean. They also usually include SE Asians (Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese). However, South Asians are usually just called "Indian" whether they are Indian or not. I've never heard an American refer to a South Indian as Asian unless it was part of some poll or publication that lumped people based on continent. In casual conversation, Asian almost never refers to people from South Asia in America. Which is strange because it's almost exactly the opposite in the U.K.<END_COMMENT>
I can see people doing this.<END_COMMENT>
Asian here as well. How I would feel if my kids were deprived of equality and fairness when it comes to schooling, awards, employment, and other opportunities, when those opportunities are systematically handed to one race or ethnicity? Fucken angry and I'd let those overseeing those opportunities know about it in the most eloquent and cogent way! Thus far I have not had to pull out any Trump cards, fortunately.<END_COMMENT>

I disagree with you on that second part.  Affirmative action is the definition of not only "discrimination on a systemic level" but also "racism on a systemic level".  Or, as one might even say, "systemic racism".<END_COMMENT>
I understand that you don't want special treatment because of your race, but how would you feel if your son or daughter didn't get into a certain college or get a job because they're Asian? Is that fair?<END_COMMENT>
affirmative action **is** discrimination on a systemic level<END_COMMENT>
Good for you. I'm white and don't think it's right for minorities to get preferential treatment over my kids in such instances either. It's wrong.<END_COMMENT>
I don't know what benefit I have over you because I'm white, but I agree that it's ridiculous that someone in this school district made the decision that Asians aren't a minority. Of course, I think all racial preferences are unconstitutional, but that hasn't prevented leftists from instituting them.<END_COMMENT>
How damn stupid are these people? They don't want you to think for yourself, you either with them or you're a racist no matter what your race is.<END_COMMENT>
I concur.<END_COMMENT>
Absolutely right. I see much more pushback from the Asian community nationwide more this election year than ever in regards to woke policies and indoctrination. It's only fitting to stand up against such practices that compromise fairness for all just for the sake of rigging numbers for a select group.<END_COMMENT>
Me too.<END_COMMENT>
Agreed<END_COMMENT>
Just wanted to say I have mad respect for you and wish you the absolute best! Best of luck in your future endeavors, with an attitude like that I have no doubt you'll be successful<END_COMMENT>
I disagree. Things should be fair and someone's race shouldn't come into play when getting a job, getting into school, or any other aspect of life.<END_COMMENT>
Good. Glad to hear it. In my experience, Asians are extremely sensible people. The least sensible are far left whites.<END_COMMENT>
I never dated outside of my race, but I guarantee you some people wouldn't like their daughter dating a white guy. In fact, I work with several Asians who have told me such when discussing their daughters.<END_COMMENT>

Old media is dying. Trump ironically provided a brief resurgence, but if he goes they're in trouble again.<END_COMMENT>
because they went kamikaze with their meritless attacks on Trump while killing their own journalistic integrity. I'm obviously speaking in hyperbole here saying they will have 0 content. Do you really believe they would have the same ratings as the previous 4 years when Trump is gone.<END_COMMENT>
CNN cannot compete with independent news media and social media. Most of CNN viewers are older boomers. Millennials and GenZ do not watch CNN, even the leftists.<END_COMMENT>
I'm praying for a miracle. The amount of hate Trump got over the last 4 years is unjustified beyond anything I've witnessed.<END_COMMENT>
Hahaha   ...and rename it the **C**onservative **N**ews **N**etwork.<END_COMMENT>

I feel sad for Joe actually. In a grandparent kinda way; I don't know what it is. I don't think the left likes him at all (except for the Baby Boom group, really). All they cared about was "voting" Trump out.<END_COMMENT>

If you look at his policies, how minorities did over the last 4 years, and the people he appointed then Trump is the worst at being racist of all time. But CNN says he is racist so must be true.<END_COMMENT>
lol    Take my upvote<END_COMMENT>
he should just reduce their pay just enough that they'll be pissed off but still stay, and force them to kiss his ass all day every day talking about how great he is/was as president.<END_COMMENT>

We have to separate the story of COVID from the fact.  Yes there is a virus. Changing presidents will not extinguish the virus, it will only placate the storytellers.  Biden will not be able to make the fact of COVID go away.<END_COMMENT>
I like the part where someone said that all 100,000 deaths in recent months should be on the right's "conscience." Because apparently under Biden, 0 people would have died.<END_COMMENT>
What the hell would Biden do anyway? Mask mandates and lockdowns.  This thing is not going to be contained.  Also stats are BS. The PCR test is trash.<END_COMMENT>

If this pandemic would have struck during the Obama administration, I guarantee that we would be in the same place we are now with the volume of cases. Our country failed on many levels with the virus, yet Trump is the only one people blame. Nothing will change under Biden.<END_COMMENT>

I remember when they said 2,000,000 were going to die in the US alone this year...<END_COMMENT>
Absolutely right on him and obama spent 8 plus years blaming everything possible on Bush<END_COMMENT>
Exactly! They showed their true level of concern by promptly celebrating together in the streets when the media declared Biden the winner. After several months of protests that is.<END_COMMENT>
One thing to blame also is our health (obesity, hypertension).  In many countries the average age of death for COVID is above the average age of death overall (UK 82 covid, 81 population in general).   In the US its lower, like 71.  Probably due to our weight and diet problems.<END_COMMENT>
Nope not at all.  When and where?<END_COMMENT>

Singapore is 3rd in population density in the world and they got Covid locked down. Singapore also tops the list of most connect airport in asia pacific. Even most countries in Africa, because of what they learnt from Ebola, managed to contain the spread of Covid by an insanely large margin. This trend around the world suggests that good governance, coupled with sensible social responsibility can actually control covid spread.<END_COMMENT>
Could you please link me where they said this?<END_COMMENT>
I remember the 'scientists' said that "if we handle the pandemic *perfectly* there will be 200,000 deaths...and if we handle it poorly, there will be 2,000,000".<END_COMMENT>

I mean, they celebrated when Trump and Ben Carson contracted it and we're hoping they would die.<END_COMMENT>
Then you're an uninformed child, not an American, or just plain stupid.<END_COMMENT>
Some people would have you believe that losing their job, their house, their car and their livelihood is all fine as long as their 89 year old Arthritis ridden Grandma who can barely walk anymore and takes 14 different medications a day that will probably be dead in less than a year didn't catch Covid.<END_COMMENT>

We've been hearing how the elderly are at most risk for how long, now all of a sudden the elderly and infirmed should get it last?   Those in a nursing home should be the first people getting this so family can start visiting them again.  My mom passed away in July all alone and we weren't able to see her one last time.  In fact we hadn't been able to see her since February but they literally don't care.<END_COMMENT>

Who<END_COMMENT>
There is no fucking evidence. A TikTok of a dude burning sample ballots in a Walmart bag? "Totally dead" people voting (but any specific examples either did not actually vote or are actually alive)? I'm dismissing these stupid lawsuits because the Trump team is grasping at straws, as evidenced by the complete lack of evidence they bring to court, and how quickly the cases are thrown out. Show me one shred of credible evidence of fraud that can't be debunked with a quick Google search.<END_COMMENT>
That would be too costly.  What will happen, if there is sufficient evidence, the Supreme Court will invalidate the election. In which case congress would decide.  1 vote for each state.  Trump would get at least 75%<END_COMMENT>
And it'll do just as well as any of the trump campaign lawsuits. Doesn't matter who files the lawsuit if it's based on nothing but fantasy.<END_COMMENT>
And how do you honestly know<END_COMMENT>
Which court was that decided in?<END_COMMENT>
Alex Jones baseless conspiracy theories are good? Asking for evidence of supposed fraud is bad? What a world.<END_COMMENT>
Trump signed into power a cyber security team after the 2016 election... Those ARE his guys. They also agree there is no evidence of voter fraud.<END_COMMENT>
Honestly, if you think it's possible to commit fraude on this supposed scale 'at the software level' without producing credible evidence, you don't understand how to process works.<END_COMMENT>
The only illegal acts I am aware of are the ones that this administration has committed on a weekly basis. The only voter fraud evidence I keep seeing are from Republicans. I legit haven't seen any proof of illegal acts or voter fraud from Democrats at all. I consider myself an objective person, hence why I read this subreddit at all, but I just haven't seen anything legitimate.<END_COMMENT>
It is completely unreasonable to believe in widespread fraude without evidence. And so far, we haven't seen anything remotely convincing.<END_COMMENT>
Why would the fraudsters not sweep the down-ballot races?<END_COMMENT>
Why would they *not*?<END_COMMENT>
Who's hampering? I've seen a lot of calls to let the recounts play out.<END_COMMENT>
The only thing simple here are the people that believe there is widespread voter fraud going on against a party that currently controls all three branches of government<END_COMMENT>

This is where the donation money is going. It ain't going towards the "massive amounts of fraud" is it?<END_COMMENT>
How about taking 4 hours to count 92% of the vote, and 2 weeks to count the last 8%.<END_COMMENT>

This is great since I struggled to pay off my student loans for over ten years and finally did it last year. Can I get a refund?<END_COMMENT>
Our taxes<END_COMMENT>
Nope, but if you were smart enough to pay it off before entering another debt in a mortgage, congratulations! The irresponsible upper middle class kids (with a parental safety net) went and bought houses while making minimal student loan payments, so the government has effectively subsidized their home purchase while the housing market becomes more expensive for you to enter.<END_COMMENT>

Everyone else is so wrong but they never have to fix their messes. No one ever follows up, it's only good intentions that matter not results.<END_COMMENT>
To normal liberals the woke crowd are just as disastrous as you think they are.<END_COMMENT>
These types seem to think that Trump was a net negative.  A lot of people liked his "Get Fucked" attitude and the fact that he wasn't a polished speaker, and sometimes he said stupid shit... but that just makes him more relatable to common people.<END_COMMENT>

The left is so left that it makes Maher look right<END_COMMENT>
He's one of the very few left-wing talking heads willing to actually call out the Democrats.  He seems to actually understand that if the Democrats don't figure out how to connect with people outside the coastal metroplex bubble that they're going to lose.  IMO he's also aware that their arrogance and open hatred that they happily spew out also means that when they *do* finally lose things will go very, very, very badly for them.  Like "at best permanently disenfranchised" badly.  And I think he's right.<END_COMMENT>
This is one of the main reasons I liked him. Had the Dems just tried to work with him they would have got a lot out of him. To bad they fucked that up so badly people actually voted for the shitter Biden.<END_COMMENT>

I went to school in the 1970s. Team Teaching was the fad for several years. They even built a school with no class rooms to prove the system worked. The idea was to group the kids into units and teachers would move through the throng in "teams." It was bedlam. No one was called out for this. No one was reprimand and the students lost two years of education. The building was repurposed and the progressives skipped off to their next failure. This is just one small example. To say otherwise is to be ignorant and backward.<END_COMMENT>

Change, yes.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't change for the sake of change, we should make sure our change actually results in a better world.  Right now the Democrats, who have fully re-embraced open racism (just with the colors inverted), are pushing for change in a direction that will make a far *worse* world.<END_COMMENT>
It's going to get much worse if Biden wins. You're right, people are dumb and incredibly misinformed. Our education system has been destroyed, we've been deliberately dumbed down for decades. Dumb people are easier to control. This country is doomed, our debt is spiraling out of control, jobs are being shipped overseas, and here comes Biden (no doubt it will be Harris when he steps down or dies) to the rescue to speed it all along. Kind of hilarious to see the left vote for everything they are supposed to be fighting against lol<END_COMMENT>

I'm entertaining the thought of learning how to survive in the wild and get off the grid.

So, here's the question that nobody is asking: if all of this is true, how do they intend to get the information out? If big tech, the media, the federal agencies, deep state, etc are all involved, who's going to actually pursue this?  The Kraken is an interesting statement... do they intend on reviving an updated Kraken bot net to distribute the information?<END_COMMENT>
What if the kraken is using the emergency message system to send the evidence to every phone in America. Those tentacles reaching anywhere.<END_COMMENT>
Good question but I believe it's going to be settled in the courts and the media will be forced to begrudgingly cover it.<END_COMMENT>
I would assume a press conference by the doj or some other government agency regarding the voter fraud allegations  would be the only way it gets out.<END_COMMENT>
Even if MSM didnt cover anything,  Newsmax, OAN and a few others would, as well as BBC, anything Australian, and other international news companies would.  Would just make MSM look bad in the end if they didn't cover something like that.<END_COMMENT>

Don't give up. Just wait until everything is investigated fully and go off of what they say. Concede the loss, and vote Trump into office in 2024<END_COMMENT>
What does that have to do with throwing out invalid ballots? There not just throwing out random ones. If I'm required to give a photo ID when voting in person, then how come other people can just be mailed ballots without even asking and no way to verify that it even went to the correct person?<END_COMMENT>
I disagree with your blanket statement that the left always contests elections as illegitimate. May I remind you that the right won more races than expected this year and yet we see most election lawsuits coming from one side of the isle.<END_COMMENT>
He retracted it legally in court, but says he didn't retract it on YouTube. Who are you going to believe? YouTube, or the Courts? Doesn't matter, because YouTube doesn't carry the force of the law.<END_COMMENT>
There really isn't any evidence of illegal voting attached to the complaint. Repeating the remote possibility of illegal voting is not evidence.  Like I said, this suit just repeats the hearsay of the other lawsuits already dismissed.  The burden of proof is a lot higher in the court than social media.<END_COMMENT>
Honestly idk if I would really want Trump again in 2024. He had good policies so it would be cool if he continued to work with the Republicans to shape the party but I think we need some new blood with a less crass/rude demeanor but it will all depend on who steps up when we get there.<END_COMMENT>
Are you somehow being denied the same ability to mail your ballot in as the other people in your state who were given that option?<END_COMMENT>

yeah china lied. but so did trump. he fucking new in february how contagious it was and how deadly it could be but he didn't do anything as to not raise a panic. he literally said this on interview.<END_COMMENT>
You mean they lied about the virus that was magically going away this easter?<END_COMMENT>
Trump also lied calling the virus a liberal hoax, saying it would go away by easter, go away with the warm weather, and that the cases would soon go to zero, and then allowing us to have the most cases in the entire world, and when asked if he would do anything differently if he had the chance to do it over again, he said no. Remember that.<END_COMMENT>
In the eyes of those who live in Taiwan, China has bullied us for 40 years, with infiltration, division, military threat, diplomatic isolation, economic suppression, stealing our technology.

Now they will use same way to corrupt the whole world, if you keep feeding CCP and Xi dynasty.<END_COMMENT>

I'm not a conservative per se, but I was amazed that the democratic-leaning news actually ran with that story. Complete bullshit.<END_COMMENT>
I know people who currently live in China, they actually do seem to have the virus under control. One of the benefits of a terrifying dictatorship - they can force the citizens to lock down.<END_COMMENT>
Work with plenty of Chinese co-workers. They absolutely have fewer cases than Indiana. It wouldn't work here for obvious reasons, but turns out that locking people in their houses and tracking everyone's GPS location on their phones actually does work on containing a virus spread<END_COMMENT>
I think it funny everyone is complaining how China lied. Yes, they wasn't transparent at first. But, they give reasonable amount of time for the world to prepare while they are locking down their cities. Meaning other country should be using their lockdown period to stock up more equipment and any possible pandemic SOP. Country like Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Australia have been doing great in such preparations. US putting all the blame to China is adsurb because they have month ahead of the countries I listed in preparation. Yet they just stand there like a moron waiting for the virus to hit their shore. After that they start to panic due to the lack of equipment and then convinently blamed China for it. TRUMP is really a terrible manager.<END_COMMENT>
Glad to hear it. Americans need to forget their partisan divisions when it comes to the China threat and problem.<END_COMMENT>

Amen. While it was still in China it was their responsibility but at soon as it reached the US it became our governments responsibility to educate and protect its people. Trump did neither and went out of his way to spread misinformation and encourage dangerous behavior.<END_COMMENT>

They're far from trustworthy, but Japan, South Korea, and actually most East and South Asian nations have been handling this very well.  Their culture isn't so individualized, and they had already normalized mask wearing well before this. Coupled with China's ability to clamp down, even going as far as locking people in their apartments, it's plausible for their numbers to be what they claim.<END_COMMENT>
You pretend that you do<END_COMMENT>
Im not even from america but how is it possible to be this delusional?<END_COMMENT>
Are there any solid proof that China is fabricating the numbers? They have already opening up their economy many months back FYI.<END_COMMENT>
the US knew about the virus before there were even a hundred cases, and now the US has over 11 million cases, china had nothing to do with that, so yes its trumps and your own faults by not doing everything you can do to stop it from going from 100 cases to 11 million.<END_COMMENT>
No. China may have originated the issue, but Trump has been more concerned with his own election this entire year than convincing US people of the dangers of the virus / wear a mask in public.  To be frank, I don't think he has a moral compass and is unfit to run this country.<END_COMMENT>
Another liberal here. It does reach across the aisle somewhat.<END_COMMENT>

How is making states bargain for supplies good policies?<END_COMMENT>
Policy-wise like when he out bid states for vital supplies and hoarded them while the country was in full panic? Or was it when he said not to worry because it would just go away?<END_COMMENT>
Trumps policy was to ignore it and state that it would go away by Easter so that Dem cities would get shit on.  What exactly was the policy beyond ignore it and make it harder for said states to acquire medical supplies?<END_COMMENT>
Yeah I hate that mean press making them feel bad about 70+ 9/11s<END_COMMENT>
It wasn't flip flipping, it was adjusting recommendations as new information was discovered. That's how these things work. Trump did about the worst thing possible in demonizing some medical professionals while giving platform to quackpots that contradicted what was being reported. I honestly think his handling of this whole thing cost him a lot of votes from centrists. This should never have been a politicized thing, and agreeing with Dems about the severity would have shown he was more concerned with the well being of individuals than playing party politics. Bad stuff happens during every presidency. It's how it is handled that makes or breaks a leader.<END_COMMENT>
The US has done horribly compared to other western nations and developed countries. Terrible leadership and another shining example why Donald Trump is a terrible president and con artist.<END_COMMENT>

I just can't believe it with how China has lied/altered history in the past (see Tiananmen Square as an obvious example). Also with an estimated ONE BILLION human beings occupying their land, who really believes that they have tested everyone showing Covid symptoms (or even close for that matter). Not to mention that the focus on China is always in relatively affluent, higher income areas, not rural China...<END_COMMENT>

Bingo! Profound mismanagement and incompetence on this front. They were forced to bid against each other. To this day he still has not utilized the defense production act.

Completely unnecessary and unacceptable failure.<END_COMMENT>

The fact that we have nearly 2 million more cases than the shithole that is India, 3 times their deaths with a fourth of their population is why most people say he did literally nothing.  He did so little, and gave so much misinformation that he did more bad than good.<END_COMMENT>

And as a note, the place right now that's doing the worst on the entire planet per capita, is South Dakota.  Not exactly a democrat run city.<END_COMMENT>
And this is why I voted Democrat for the first time in my life, and I despise Biden.  At least there will be relevant actions and science can be a thing that's relevant again.  Simply screaming FAKE NEWS MEDIA BAD!!! everytime someone says something you don't like and attempting to literally fabricate a narrative out of thin air is obnoxious.  Yes, Trump was good for the economy but he also inherited an economy that was already booming.  If he'd have handled Covid like a responsible, sensible leader the election would have been a slam dunk for him.  We'd be rolling into fall with 5000~ cases a day, instead we're pushing 200k. But he didn't, hasn't, and doesn't plan to.<END_COMMENT>

Did anyone actually read the article???<END_COMMENT>
That's unheard outside of fraud. At most you'd expect .5%<END_COMMENT>
This article explicitly says that no outcomes were changed. The recounts found votes for the Democrats too.<END_COMMENT>

This is indicative of what is so wrong with this sub and conservative echo chambers. They only amplify the things that confirm their pre conceived notions, truth be damned.<END_COMMENT>

Yup and so many folks making grandiose theories and statements based off the title alone.<END_COMMENT>
Accordion to the article it was a transcription error, not fraud, the campaign was originally given the correct totals and notified the elections office, and it didn't change the outcome of the election.<END_COMMENT>
Apparently not. And I think the headline is editorialized<END_COMMENT>
 ... it's almost as if 450+ people upvoted that comment without reading the article.<END_COMMENT>
They say that it wasn't caused by fraud... If that's true, imagine what happens if there is fraud.<END_COMMENT>
Well the percentage could be higher in areas with fewer voters without it necessarily being fraud. But it still wouldn't bode well that in an election with fewer voters they can't manage to count the votes accurately the first time...<END_COMMENT>
It's most likely not true. The article never mentions 6% so I'm assuming OP is talking about Dave Wheeler. He got around  75,000 votes so the 1,600 difference would be around 2%.<END_COMMENT>
What fraud are you talking about?  The democratic candidates also picked up around a 6% increase in total votes.  The relative percentages were basically unchanged.  You clearly didn't read the article.<END_COMMENT>
[https://archive.is/YF0mB](https://archive.is/YF0mB)<END_COMMENT>
Did you read the whole article? There were a few dems who picked up votes, from republicans. Again, this only shows the process is working, and we should all be very happy about that. States aren't going to certify an election through a bipartisan committee if the metrics they were using, do not add up. They will do what they did here, find the problem, make corrections, and look into the incident to make sure it wasn't intentional and illegal.<END_COMMENT>

I have a remote co-worker that lives up there, he said the same thing,  VT, NH, and Maine should have had Trump up by minimum 8-10 percentage points, which is further proof of massive ballot fraud since they also use the same Dominion system and widespread fraudulent mail-in voting.<END_COMMENT>

Yeah, I'll grant you that. I'm just trying to point out that this isn't some indicator of some major conspiracy as most of the other posters in the thread seem to think. The number of votes increased across the board, and may largely be attributable to them spending more time vetting and agreeing on cases where voter intention was not explicitly clear originally.<END_COMMENT>

No, I don't think that's true. I think he would do anything within his legal rights to make sure he lost his election fairly after four years of precedent where attempts were made non-stop to take him down. I do think, however, that if he lost those legal challenges, which again he has the right to pursue, then he would step down & transition to the next administration. I can't fault him for being skeptical at this time but once that window for legal options closes, if he doesn't come out with the victory, I think he'll leave.<END_COMMENT>
I criticized Obama so I must support Trump? Not sure I follow your logic. Drone strikes on civilians are never okay, no matter who's the President. Your articles do a fantastic job, however, of proving that we need to curb executive power ASAP before Biden can do more damage.<END_COMMENT>

A decrepit, racist career politician and his divisive female sidekick who loves to screw over the black race? Buckle up. It will be more than bumpy.<END_COMMENT>
Most people on r/politics agree with these thugs.<END_COMMENT>
They punched women and children<END_COMMENT>

Fox News has lost me.  This caption seems to imply that the MAGA March descended into violence with no help at all from agitators after the PEACEFUL demonstration as the day ended.<END_COMMENT>
I am a huge freedom of speech advocate, but isn't the sign they are carrying illegal? There are a limited number of things you cannot say. These include: libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets...How does "Punch a MAGA", not fall under incitement of violence? They are literally telling people to go assault Trump supporters, and people are doing it.<END_COMMENT>
It's funny because all they can do is sucker punch<END_COMMENT>
See how all the lefties are silent about this? Fucking disgusting trash<END_COMMENT>
Already building a sweet new AR10. Although I live in a state where the alt-left would be highly outnumbered with guns to bodies even in the smallest of towns.<END_COMMENT>
Time to start punching back. That is all.<END_COMMENT>

"We call ourselves the anti-bad guy squad. Therefore anything we do is good because we're the good guys. We can't be bad because our name literally means that we're fighting the bad guys. Anyone who opposes what we do must simply be one of the bad guys".<END_COMMENT>
Wait until they realize that there isn't a whole hell of a big difference between communism and fascism.<END_COMMENT>
The media has decided that anyone that voted for Trump is a far right extremist.<END_COMMENT>
They're still acting like Trump was just a phase, something they had to ride out until they could return to Establishment status quo.  With Biden appearing to have won they're trying to revert to where they were pre-Trump and desperately hoping the right-leaning population will go back to being sheep content to let the Establishment shear and slaughter them.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah man fr, fox news used to be my go to news source.  Any recommendations for new news channels?<END_COMMENT>
Just sounds like more peaceful protesting, nothing to see here.<END_COMMENT>

Some of them came here to say that these folks in the picture are right wingers disguised as antifa, trying to make the antifas look bad.<END_COMMENT>
The mods over there were banning links to Biden's own website listing his gun policies, saying it was "right-wing propaganda". That place is a joke and IMO only comes off as a place for people to circlejerk it off to guns and taticool porn. At least, that's what it has boiled itself down to, might of not been that bad a few years ago but 2020 has really done a number on big chunk of reddit.<END_COMMENT>
Oh, you think so?  Here's what is interesting.  There was left wing violence PRIMARILY through the 60's and 70's.  We started seeing "right wing" violence in the late 70's until now.  But I think it still dwarfs the left wing violence starting the middle of last century from the left.  All of this violence in DC... do you think it will be RECORDED as "left wing violence"?  Because I don't.  I think that the people who "keep track" of this left versus right wing violence have been biased in their list-keeping.  I believe they do so deliberately in order to stoke fear that danger comes only from one side of the political spectrum.<END_COMMENT>

how is it not fascist to attack people that you disagree with and then call them fascists?<END_COMMENT>
Fox has chosen to be the new CNN. They have become the very thing we fight against.<END_COMMENT>
Fuck the lying media. Their coordinated attack on America will fail absolutely.<END_COMMENT>
I'll still watch Tucker and still think there are SOME good people there.  But they did a straight-up Pravda piece the other day claiming that this was the most secure election ever ever ever...<END_COMMENT>
I may be in the minority here, but I never considered Fox to be a great news source. It's still controlled by the same corporate interests as all the others, just with a different marketing approach.<END_COMMENT>
I will accept your premise when you show me Trump supporters marching with a banner calling to punch anyone else...<END_COMMENT>
Agree completely. With all those violent hordes of Biden voters out there assaulting people it's imperative that you stay safe and take precautions to protect yourself.<END_COMMENT>
The bitch bridgade<END_COMMENT>
The problem is that when they punch (or worse) you they get charges dropped.  When you defend yourself the Establishment railroads you and does everything they can to bury you and destroy your life.  Look at how Kyle Rittenhouse is getting treated despite the plethora of video making what happened more than clearly self-defense.<END_COMMENT>
If its so obvious where's your proof?<END_COMMENT>
An honest to god single digit IQ in the wild. What an incredible thing to witness.<END_COMMENT>
And you'd be right.<END_COMMENT>
Actually I meant 365. I was looking at 226 all last week, though.<END_COMMENT>
Wanting defense is disgusting to you?  You're going to really hate that we're getting our conceal carry permit, too.<END_COMMENT>
What's fucking disgusting is ANTIFA attacking a woman of color with children at an actual peaceful rally. Get a clue<END_COMMENT>
I bet you statists are excited to disarm Americans and imprison anyone for wrongthink.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah, if those americans are violent and attack him, he has a right to defend himself. It's why the second amendment is pretty great. Do you think someone who buys a gun to defend themselves after seeing political violence is "excited"? Sounds like they're cautious and using their rights to defend themselves and their family after seeing calls for violence against half of the US.<END_COMMENT>

Good, we need to put pressure on China and get concessions now. Biden will just forfeit all our advantages to China.<END_COMMENT>
IF Biden actually won and proceeded to undo all of President Trumps anti-China policies, does anyone really believe for even a second that the media would cover it?<END_COMMENT>
Recognize Taiwan in an official capacity. Sanction China for abuse of Uighurs. Remove their rare earth lease holdings in the US, disallow chinese students studying here due to high risk espionage and IP theft.<END_COMMENT>
A lot of leaders around the world don't like Trump because he's not someone that you can make backroom deals with compared to established politicians.<END_COMMENT>
Nope. And I will be pissed if he actually does undo everything trump has accomplished. So sad.<END_COMMENT>
And if they do cover it, they will try to spin it as "another step closer to world peace" or some BS while Xinnie the Pooh opens up more camps and Sleepy Joe builds more cages.<END_COMMENT>
But he did win with every mainstream media outlet and poll against him? What china doesnt like is a strong leader that they cant push around<END_COMMENT>
Triggered!!!!!!<END_COMMENT>
Trump has exposed Bidens family dealings in china and how our money ends up funding their weapons. That combined with the crackdowns hes planning will make it very hard for him to do anything without exposing himself as a commie to Americans<END_COMMENT>
Projection of Sleepy Joe allowing China to do what they want.<END_COMMENT>
The TPP would have just moved labeling of products to other countries. Nothing, literally nothing else, would have changed<END_COMMENT>
I dont know about you guys... But i trust a man who spent his whole life in the economy building an empire to repair it more than Sleepy Joe.<END_COMMENT>
Let me guess... he will raise the money by selling The United States to china and put his son in charge of the handover.<END_COMMENT>
So he wants to effectively double our debt?<END_COMMENT>
Goal is not repair of the US economy, it's coming up with enough goodies, generating sufficient dependence on the federal government to keep control for a long time.<END_COMMENT>
You, good sir, made me spit out my coffee. Well done.<END_COMMENT>

Your consent form has been denied on account of the fact that you voted red last election. Please consider voting blue for renewed privileges.<END_COMMENT>
It's mostly homeless and druggies that are doing it AFAIK. They aren't allowed into businesses due to sanity reasons or theft. Instead of doing something to curb the homeless issue, the city instead offers protections for them (Portland is starting to do the same) which gives more incentives to stay or become homeless rather than cleaning their act up and become a functioning member of society. There's also a portion of them suffering from mental illness (sadly some of them are veterans) but we have no systems in place to help them or financial incentives to do so.<END_COMMENT>
So your saying the state has a right to dictate to private property owners what they can, and cannot allow inside the owners private property?<END_COMMENT>
Define shitty behavior<END_COMMENT>
Ok, fair enough, but if you live in a place that allows smoking according to the lease... then tough luck<END_COMMENT>
The even clearer evidence is that they caused a massive spike in violent crime. The Ferguson effect is real, even though the mainstream media won't talk about it.  Every city that had BLM riots has seen violent crime SKYROCKET.<END_COMMENT>
Truly unbelievable the amount of damage that this angry terrorist mob has brought.<END_COMMENT>
....... to the black community.<END_COMMENT>
And vice versa. The far left will go back to calling Biden a neoliberal centrist who's part of the problem.<END_COMMENT>
Biden won, now they try to get rid of them as their usefulness has left.<END_COMMENT>

Well, you have to remember that /r/Politics is full of people who live off of welfare. They're the kind of people who give up on a job because "welfare pays better." People over there have been conditioned to believe that your best route to success is leeching off of others. It's likely they see insurance as welfare for capitalists.<END_COMMENT>

Average trump supporter vs average leftist. I'm going with the Trump supporter lol. As an example, look at AOC freaking out about a garbage disposal. I've noticed many lefties tend to be the types who can't do shit on their own and always need assistance.<END_COMMENT>
Where do you live? I'm thinking of having a "Peaceful" BLM protest at your door step.<END_COMMENT>

I'm down with that. We can "peacefully" burn a cross, and "peacefully" shine lights into their home at night, and "peacefully" chant insane leftist rhetoric. All above board. Just so fucking "mostly peaceful".<END_COMMENT>
I also forgot to mention the insurance companies that do pay out. The money goes to the business/higher up and not the low end workers.<END_COMMENT>

Why do you care about a chair?! People are more important than property!! /s<END_COMMENT>
It's just a chair over your head. Not a big deal yo.<END_COMMENT>
Not surprising at all considering the media still refuse to acknowledge Antifa's violence<END_COMMENT>
Notice how they are now using the "normalization of violence" that we've been concerned about with the lefts unended stream of violence. They're gonna keep using that phase so that  when leftist violence inevitably gets even MORE rediculous they can blame the right.<END_COMMENT>
One look at r/politics and it's clear...they all swallow it down and regurgitate it back with joyous vitriol<END_COMMENT>
The Covington kids was one of the events that really opened my eyes to the incredible bias of the media.<END_COMMENT>

it's not ridiculous to think that the left is doing 98% of all the violence.<END_COMMENT>

Did Biden say that, too? I saw a clip of Jerry Nadler saying it.<END_COMMENT>
WTF happened to Fox? they seem to have spiralled out of control in the last couple weeks.<END_COMMENT>
I'm starting to think they want violence from the right as retaliation, so they can have a reason to take guns. They realized they lost all arguments in the gun control debate, so this is their next plan. As we know, don't let a crisis go to waste.<END_COMMENT>
funny, i don't remember proud boys looting and burning cities for months and months. and if there was anybody profiting from the conflict, I think the profiting was only on one side and the profit was nikes and liquor store cash registers.<END_COMMENT>
Those people are proudly carrying a sign advocating punching their fellow Americans.<END_COMMENT>
True! Actually I suppose I should thank them for letting me know. Otherwise I could have lived my whole life happy and never realized how my kindness and hardworking nature was just a mask for my capitalist privilege. I'd better burn my stuff right now, hold on a sec<END_COMMENT>
Joe Biden said it in a presidential debate I believe.<END_COMMENT>
Nadler said there is no such thing as left wing violence.<END_COMMENT>
Ask them to actually define fascism and identify who they believe are fascists and then come back to me and say it's "not a bad thing at all".<END_COMMENT>

how short do you think peoples' memories are? it's not nearly long enough gone that BLM and antifa were looting and burning that we've forgotten already. just because the media has told everyone to forget about BLM's wave of terror, doesn't mean that anyone actually has.<END_COMMENT>

You do realize that the number of Proud Boys in DC was miniscule and the antifas wanted to punch MAGA people in the face and not just Proud Boys, right?<END_COMMENT>
It WAS peaceful, until later in the day when the antifa crowd managed to separate Trump supporters for the purposes of assaulting them.<END_COMMENT>
Yes it was peaceful.  Want to know why?  Because no building or personal property was being looted and destroyed and no one was hurt until Antifa showed up.<END_COMMENT>

He can literally say "we need to end individual liberty" in a way that's not only appealing, but hard to argue against. And he gets airtime because he was a former President, which makes it all the more absurd. Full disclosure, I voted for Obama twice. In my defense, I was young... But I know what it's like to follow someone because it sounds nice enough. A lot of people do that.<END_COMMENT>
Well, of there was anyone intimately familiar with blackface...<END_COMMENT>
This will not go over well in the gay community.<END_COMMENT>
Who's the bigger joke.. the PM, or the fucking half wits who voted for him?<END_COMMENT>
You do realize its satire right??<END_COMMENT>
No. Why the fuck would someone believe this.<END_COMMENT>
I legit know a Canadian that only voted for him because he was handsome.. I nearly gave myself a concussion from my face palm. And then you realize there's probably a large % that's voted for Obama with the same reason.<END_COMMENT>
For some people all it takes is virtue signalling and to be well spoken.<END_COMMENT>
Sounds like my mother in law<END_COMMENT>
They voted for him because he was black.  Nevermind that he was raised by rich white people... he's basically a real life version of a white man in black face.<END_COMMENT>
Shame there are so many brain damaged people who think like this. I find it odd to think Canada is considered so great when we have all these idiots who just use his face as being handsome instead of actually thinking of what he has done and judging him. Its always excuses with them and he is like some sort of deity in their eyes. I've hated being Canadian since 2015 when that idiot was elected and I'll continue to hate being a citizen of this country until he is no longer prime minister.<END_COMMENT>
Why?<END_COMMENT>
Glad to see you come to the rational conclusion that I hoped you would come to.<END_COMMENT>
MSM throws tantrum. Life continues anyway.<END_COMMENT>

They need to rename imo, newsmax sounds like a detergent brand<END_COMMENT>
Well, it's because black and Hispanic voters generally don't buy into "woke" bullshit.<END_COMMENT>

Last time France tried to shut down the churches, Napoleon had to step in.<END_COMMENT>
Let's see them close the mosques lmao<END_COMMENT>
On the plus side, no radical Muslims will be able to behead anyone attending church..<END_COMMENT>
Bring on the downvotes and self-righteous moral shaming for not agreeing with lockdowns and mask mandates.<END_COMMENT>
At some point you have to let people make their own decisions. If they feel healthy and safe, then go. If they're not sure, then stay home. Easy as that. Just give people the freedom to choose and most people will choose correctly.<END_COMMENT>

Well, maybe not "devout". My point was that when France tries to shut down churches, it doesn't go well.<END_COMMENT>
 What office is Biden taking?<END_COMMENT>
This is also an indication of how shit Fox News is becoming.  It wasn't violence between antifa and "far right extremists" as you see on the crawl.  Antifa was attacking families.  Antifa was setting off fireworks at restaurants where people were eating.<END_COMMENT>
As a left-leaning libertarian, I condemn this type of action and discourse, and I wish other leftists would do the same. These idiots do not represent us.<END_COMMENT>
Anyone gonna ask Biden to disavow the violence and tell his goons to back down?<END_COMMENT>
On behalf of every American with a brain. Fuck Antifa!<END_COMMENT>
This is the reason I stopped watching news in early August. I can't take it 24/7. If anyone believes once Biden is sworn in we're going to have a kinder gentler nation and he'll do wonders for people of color, you're smoking something powerful. A decrepit, racist career politician and his divisive female sidekick who loves to screw over the black race? Buckle up. It will be more than bumpy.<END_COMMENT>
Most people on r/politics agree with these thugs.<END_COMMENT>
They punched women and children<END_COMMENT>

Fox News has lost me.  This caption seems to imply that the MAGA March descended into violence with no help at all from agitators after the PEACEFUL demonstration as the day ended.<END_COMMENT>
I am a huge freedom of speech advocate, but isn't the sign they are carrying illegal? There are a limited number of things you cannot say. These include: libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets...How does "Punch a MAGA", not fall under incitement of violence? They are literally telling people to go assault Trump supporters, and people are doing it.<END_COMMENT>
It's funny because all they can do is sucker punch<END_COMMENT>
Country coming together nicely<END_COMMENT>
See how all the lefties are silent about this? Fucking disgusting trash<END_COMMENT>

Wait until they realize that there isn't a whole hell of a big difference between communism and fascism.<END_COMMENT>
The media has decided that anyone that voted for Trump is a far right extremist.<END_COMMENT>
They're still acting like Trump was just a phase, something they had to ride out until they could return to Establishment status quo.  With Biden appearing to have won they're trying to revert to where they were pre-Trump and desperately hoping the right-leaning population will go back to being sheep content to let the Establishment shear and slaughter them.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah man fr, fox news used to be my go to news source.  Any recommendations for new news channels?<END_COMMENT>
Just sounds like more peaceful protesting, nothing to see here.<END_COMMENT>
Totally, flag and guns, and bullet proof vests just in case. You can't go to a rally without them.<END_COMMENT>
He's so dumb.  They think that HE is a fascist, too.  They have said as much.<END_COMMENT>

Some of them came here to say that these folks in the picture are right wingers disguised as antifa, trying to make the antifas look bad.<END_COMMENT>
The mods over there were banning links to Biden's own website listing his gun policies, saying it was "right-wing propaganda". That place is a joke and IMO only comes off as a place for people to circlejerk it off to guns and taticool porn. At least, that's what it has boiled itself down to, might of not been that bad a few years ago but 2020 has really done a number on big chunk of reddit.<END_COMMENT>
Oh, you think so?  Here's what is interesting.  There was left wing violence PRIMARILY through the 60's and 70's.  We started seeing "right wing" violence in the late 70's until now.  But I think it still dwarfs the left wing violence starting the middle of last century from the left.  All of this violence in DC... do you think it will be RECORDED as "left wing violence"?  Because I don't.  I think that the people who "keep track" of this left versus right wing violence have been biased in their list-keeping.  I believe they do so deliberately in order to stoke fear that danger comes only from one side of the political spectrum.<END_COMMENT>

how is it not fascist to attack people that you disagree with and then call them fascists?<END_COMMENT>
Fox has chosen to be the new CNN. They have become the very thing we fight against.<END_COMMENT>
Fuck the lying media. Their coordinated attack on America will fail absolutely.<END_COMMENT>
I'll still watch Tucker and still think there are SOME good people there.  But they did a straight-up Pravda piece the other day claiming that this was the most secure election ever ever ever...<END_COMMENT>
I may be in the minority here, but I never considered Fox to be a great news source. It's still controlled by the same corporate interests as all the others, just with a different marketing approach.<END_COMMENT>
I will accept your premise when you show me Trump supporters marching with a banner calling to punch anyone else...<END_COMMENT>
Agree completely. With all those violent hordes of Biden voters out there assaulting people it's imperative that you stay safe and take precautions to protect yourself.<END_COMMENT>
The bitch bridgade<END_COMMENT>
The problem is that when they punch (or worse) you they get charges dropped.  When you defend yourself the Establishment railroads you and does everything they can to bury you and destroy your life.  Look at how Kyle Rittenhouse is getting treated despite the plethora of video making what happened more than clearly self-defense.<END_COMMENT>
If its so obvious where's your proof?<END_COMMENT>
An honest to god single digit IQ in the wild. What an incredible thing to witness.<END_COMMENT>
This would make headlines nationwide if ANY news network could prove that they were right wing<END_COMMENT>
And you'd be right.<END_COMMENT>
Actually I meant 365. I was looking at 226 all last week, though.<END_COMMENT>
Wanting defense is disgusting to you?  You're going to really hate that we're getting our conceal carry permit, too.<END_COMMENT>
What's fucking disgusting is ANTIFA attacking a woman of color with children at an actual peaceful rally. Get a clue<END_COMMENT>
I bet you statists are excited to disarm Americans and imprison anyone for wrongthink.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah, if those americans are violent and attack him, he has a right to defend himself. It's why the second amendment is pretty great. Do you think someone who buys a gun to defend themselves after seeing political violence is "excited"? Sounds like they're cautious and using their rights to defend themselves and their family after seeing calls for violence against half of the US.<END_COMMENT>

I mean, who needs cable/sat?  Just stream!<END_COMMENT>
I hope.  America has had massive distrust for the media for years now.  Hell, most people I talk to anymore get their news from independent sources and people on YouTube.  One of the greatest things that could happen for our country is if the legacy media finally dies.<END_COMMENT>
And not a single tear was shed.<END_COMMENT>
Isn't cable in general already a dying medium? This shouldn't be surprising since everyone is moving online in preparation.<END_COMMENT>

Who bothers to watch the news?<END_COMMENT>
I want to believe.<END_COMMENT>
Great. Now let's see them go and win in court. And show the world. Not just talk about it over and over. Let's prove it and get Trump reelected already.<END_COMMENT>
...and who started that?<END_COMMENT>
Good, we need to put pressure on China and get concessions now. Biden will just forfeit all our advantages to China.<END_COMMENT>
IF Biden actually won and proceeded to undo all of President Trumps anti-China policies, does anyone really believe for even a second that the media would cover it?<END_COMMENT>
Recognize Taiwan in an official capacity. Sanction China for abuse of Uighurs. Remove their rare earth lease holdings in the US, disallow chinese students studying here due to high risk espionage and IP theft.<END_COMMENT>
A lot of leaders around the world don't like Trump because he's not someone that you can make backroom deals with compared to established politicians.<END_COMMENT>
Nope. And I will be pissed if he actually does undo everything trump has accomplished. So sad.<END_COMMENT>
And if they do cover it, they will try to spin it as "another step closer to world peace" or some BS while Xinnie the Pooh opens up more camps and Sleepy Joe builds more cages.<END_COMMENT>
But he did win with every mainstream media outlet and poll against him? What china doesnt like is a strong leader that they cant push around<END_COMMENT>
Triggered!!!!!!<END_COMMENT>
Trump has exposed Bidens family dealings in china and how our money ends up funding their weapons. That combined with the crackdowns hes planning will make it very hard for him to do anything without exposing himself as a commie to Americans<END_COMMENT>
Projection of Sleepy Joe allowing China to do what they want.<END_COMMENT>

It's mostly homeless and druggies that are doing it AFAIK. They aren't allowed into businesses due to sanity reasons or theft. Instead of doing something to curb the homeless issue, the city instead offers protections for them (Portland is starting to do the same) which gives more incentives to stay or become homeless rather than cleaning their act up and become a functioning member of society. There's also a portion of them suffering from mental illness (sadly some of them are veterans) but we have no systems in place to help them or financial incentives to do so.<END_COMMENT>
CA cities have homelessness on a scale that is kind of crazy if you've mostly lived in the Midwest, South, etc. They literally have vast populations of homeless people because of the extreme inequality their policies have created.<END_COMMENT>
So your saying the state has a right to dictate to private property owners what they can, and cannot allow inside the owners private property?<END_COMMENT>

The even clearer evidence is that they caused a massive spike in violent crime. The Ferguson effect is real, even though the mainstream media won't talk about it.  Every city that had BLM riots has seen violent crime SKYROCKET.<END_COMMENT>
