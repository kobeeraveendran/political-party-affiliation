No fan of Trump but if this is true, well done.<END_COMMENT>
What are the consequences of a US pullout of Afghanistan? What vacuum does it create and will this groundwork prevent the circumstances that put the US there in the first place?<END_COMMENT>
I'm sure the war drums will start beating again once the swamp is back in the white house. If they keep us scared and mad at poor brown people in distant lands, we won't have our focus on what they're doing to us.<END_COMMENT>
This is one of two reasons I voted for Trump. These forever wars have to end. No benefit whatsoever from our presence there.<END_COMMENT>
Why now and not 4 years ago? or 3 years ago? or 2?<END_COMMENT>
If Trump loses in court and Biden takes over. I give it less than year before those troops turn right back around and are back in Afghanistan.<END_COMMENT>
should be easy as he has 4 more years<END_COMMENT>

Folks, free speech is under attack, worldwide. WaPo penned an article on the heels of a few European nations recently banning hate speech, detailing why the US needs hate speech laws. If we lose the 1st and 2nd, America is lost.<END_COMMENT>

This needs to be upvoted excessively. It is almost impossible to understate how important the 1st Amendment (in its current form) is to freedom of debate, criticism, etc in this country. I know people who left communist countries and were thrilled when they could come here and speak openly about whatever they wanted to. Stuff like this scares the living daylights out of them (and me).<END_COMMENT>
The First Amendment isn't flawed. This bullshit logic is flawed. I hope this article is either shenanigans or wishful thinking. If not, It's our duty as Americans to take up arms and occupy the streets to abolish this evil within our nation.<END_COMMENT>

so coming from a guy that gave weapons to the cartels, gave money to terrorists, and the lists go on. sit down Powerpuff girl because you just want Biden to win so your little trafficking buddies can start the Epstien.2 airlines so you cN catch up with Bills flight record.<END_COMMENT>

Now let's hope the prosecution papers this case and/or doesn't lower the charge. They are famous for taking cases that are plain as day ADW's and turning them into Simple Assault or dropping the case all together. All so they can be sure they win or don't get a loss on their record. Justice doesn't mean jack shit to most of the attorneys in DC.<END_COMMENT>
The Obamas are all media hype and little substance<END_COMMENT>
So the left's take from that is there is 72.7 million racists still out the to be silenced. /s<END_COMMENT>
As far as I'm concerned, unity is not happening. Biden is clearly a child predator by what I've seen. His Camel lady VP called him a racist. I will never unify with pedos and racists or their supporters. I will be the bigger man and at least recognize Biden as Pres if the courts show no voter fraud. But I will not be acquainted with low quality humans that support pedophiles and racists<END_COMMENT>
The [Great Barrington Proclamation](https://gbdeclaration.org/view-signatures/) which opposes general lockdowns and favors focused protection now has 12,002 medical and public health care scientists supporting it, and 34,663 medical practitioners supporting it.

This is what great reset looks like<END_COMMENT>
They're going to do this to us until every small business is destroyed and we're begging for socialism if they'll just stop it.<END_COMMENT>
Rand is right.  These lockdowns are getting beyond farcical.  Why are we locking down the entire country when this virus primarily targets the elderly?  Why should everyone else have to have their entire lives disrupted?  Can't we just quarantine the elderly and let everyone else get on with their lives?<END_COMMENT>
bUt mUh CaSeS yU iZ gRAnDmA kIlLeR!!!! *curtain twitching*<END_COMMENT>
As many have suggested, it will be a full-on lockdown for 6-8 weeks, then, with the vaccine coming out, the virus will be "contained or manageable" and we'll be told we can get back to life as normal. This is all assuming Biden becomes president.<END_COMMENT>

And while Biden is saying "there is a time to heal" (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8) other democrats are calling to "essentially, burn down the Republican Party" - Jennifer Rubin.<END_COMMENT>
For the last four years we have been called racists, homophobs, cheaters, nazis,and every other name they can think of. Now that they think they have the Whitehouse Biden and Harris are calling for unity? I don't think so. Not while your party has yet to denounce the antifa and blm attacks and violence, not while the Dems have called for making a list of trump supporters so they can interrupt our lives, and not while your party continues to fight to remove our God given rights. You see we believe that we have rights and the constitution doesn't give us those rights it just affirms the rights we have.<END_COMMENT>
We will not compromise our values and let the leftists walk all over us. We have our rights and freedoms and we deserve to make our own choices.<END_COMMENT>
Never offer unity to people who wouldn't consider offering it to you in return.<END_COMMENT>
No unity. No surrender. Trump has handed the Republican party it's spine back. Use it or lose it.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah lets sweep all the illegal corruption and evidence of election tampering under the rug, hug it out while terrorist beat you with bricks and chains, hold hands while your rights get dissolved and happily sing together as the country's economy tanks... you'll just have to stay home while jobs, service and products disappear because covid but they'll all be flying private their private jets and having parties to celebrate "our" unity.<END_COMMENT>

Asians, I welcome you to the white category.<END_COMMENT>
Here's an idea: instead of race baiting with identity politics, why not just label the category impoverished or underprivileged students that can include those of any skin color or background... You know, have subsidies based on someone's actual need rather than having such benefits based on the color of someone's skin.<END_COMMENT>
Welcome Asians you can now oppress the minorities with us<END_COMMENT>
This stuff is bullshittery. Race classifications should just be ignored entirely.<END_COMMENT>
Revealing that once again it's not really about race, it's about the moral imperative of indiscriminateness.  The thing is about success vs victimization - that's how the Left views the world. Any person, or group, that's successful must be bad.<END_COMMENT>
Progressives are racists with guilty cnsciences. Well, welcome to the club Asians. Most of us legal African immigrants and black conservatives are in the same boat. We aren't "black enough"<END_COMMENT>

We have to separate the story of COVID from the fact.  Yes there is a virus. Changing presidents will not extinguish the virus, it will only placate the storytellers.  Biden will not be able to make the fact of COVID go away.<END_COMMENT>
I like the part where someone said that all 100,000 deaths in recent months should be on the right's "conscience." Because apparently under Biden, 0 people would have died.<END_COMMENT>
What the hell would Biden do anyway? Mask mandates and lockdowns.  This thing is not going to be contained.  Also stats are BS. The PCR test is trash.<END_COMMENT>

He is a racist. As a biracial person myself, I don't choose my minority side to help get me better jobs<END_COMMENT>
I saw him on '60 Minutes' tonight talking about Trump not accepting the results of the election. This coming from a man whose party still hasn't accepted the results of the 2016 election. He fits in perfectly with the rest of the hypocrites in his tribe.<END_COMMENT>

To normal liberals the woke crowd are just as disastrous as you think they are.<END_COMMENT>
These types seem to think that Trump was a net negative.  A lot of people liked his "Get Fucked" attitude and the fact that he wasn't a polished speaker, and sometimes he said stupid shit... but that just makes him more relatable to common people.<END_COMMENT>

There is only one kraken and he is a half Asian lawyer<END_COMMENT>
So, here's the question that nobody is asking: if all of this is true, how do they intend to get the information out? If big tech, the media, the federal agencies, deep state, etc are all involved, who's going to actually pursue this?  The Kraken is an interesting statement... do they intend on reviving an updated Kraken bot net to distribute the information?<END_COMMENT>
What if the kraken is using the emergency message system to send the evidence to every phone in America. Those tentacles reaching anywhere.<END_COMMENT>
I'll believe it when it gets ruled on. So far, not a single one of these lawsuits alleging large-scale fraud (or error, for that matter) has even remotely panned out.<END_COMMENT>

Oh, the lies and hypocrisy. Does Bill Cosby write his jokes?<END_COMMENT>
Why, if they are so sure they won, why are they fighting so hard? If Trump is wrong this will make him look more like a stooge so why are they trying to stop him?<END_COMMENT>
Of course China lies. According to them, they have fewer cases and deaths than Indiana.<END_COMMENT>
China lied and did nothing. Then our own leaders lied and many innocent Americans died. Fucking shame.<END_COMMENT>
I mostly lean towards liberal ideas and this is something that I would agree on. Fuck the CCP.<END_COMMENT>

yeah china lied. but so did trump. he fucking new in february how contagious it was and how deadly it could be but he didn't do anything as to not raise a panic. he literally said this on interview.<END_COMMENT>
You mean they lied about the virus that was magically going away this easter?<END_COMMENT>
Trump also lied calling the virus a liberal hoax, saying it would go away by easter, go away with the warm weather, and that the cases would soon go to zero, and then allowing us to have the most cases in the entire world, and when asked if he would do anything differently if he had the chance to do it over again, he said no. Remember that.<END_COMMENT>
In the eyes of those who live in Taiwan, China has bullied us for 40 years, with infiltration, division, military threat, diplomatic isolation, economic suppression, stealing our technology. And it got worse due to captalists and nations world wide enjoying low cost and big market in China over past 2 decades, at the cost of Chiese people's human right.

Absolutely disgusting. How are you going to ask someone a question and then completely override them and not let them answer it? You are supposed to want to get the whole story out as a news company right? Apparently not in 2020. You can't argue with people who have already been bought out.<END_COMMENT>

Social media as a whole needs to go away. People are not meant to communicate in the way that twitter and FB emphasize. Message boards and forums have existed for years no problem, but mainstream media require way too much personal info.<END_COMMENT>
Idk, I checked it out and while there are some conservative names there, the site itself is a ghost town of spam<END_COMMENT>
No offense guys but Parler seems pretty trash to me<END_COMMENT>

No, I don't think that's true. I think he would do anything within his legal rights to make sure he lost his election fairly after four years of precedent where attempts were made non-stop to take him down. I do think, however, that if he lost those legal challenges, which again he has the right to pursue, then he would step down & transition to the next administration. I can't fault him for being skeptical at this time but once that window for legal options closes, if he doesn't come out with the victory, I think he'll leave.<END_COMMENT>
Did the article change? The title of the in no way matches what is in the article now. And looking at the numbers there is no way it was close to 6%, and votes were added for both sides. In almost all cases the margin of victory stayed the same and no results were flipped. I'm super confused.<END_COMMENT>
Did anyone actually read the article???<END_COMMENT>
That's unheard outside of fraud. At most you'd expect .5%<END_COMMENT>
This article explicitly says that no outcomes were changed. The recounts found votes for the Democrats too.<END_COMMENT>
The article itself tells a very different story than the title does. Classic case of a misleading header...<END_COMMENT>
And yet again, nobody read the article<END_COMMENT>

This is also an indication of how shit Fox News is becoming.  It wasn't violence between antifa and "far right extremists" as you see on the crawl.  Antifa was attacking families.  Antifa was setting off fireworks at restaurants where people were eating.<END_COMMENT>

On behalf of every American with a brain. Fuck Antifa!<END_COMMENT>
This is the reason I stopped watching news in early August. I can't take it 24/7. If anyone believes once Biden is sworn in we're going to have a kinder gentler nation and he'll do wonders for people of color, you're smoking something powerful.

Trump is the only guy who would bide his time in the most powerful position in the world to get his true objective, his own teevee channel. It just shows what has been obvious since he used fake names to call in blind items about himself to the tabloids in the 80s, his driving obsessions are not money or power but celebrity and fame.<END_COMMENT>
I think Trump should just fulfill his destiny as a media executive. I don't even know if I'd watch but it would make the most sense and would certainly ensure his continual influence over conservative politics.<END_COMMENT>

Except Fredo said himself that they do not want the vaccine in their state, using it solely as a mentally ill leftist political move that leads to more people dying under his watch.<END_COMMENT>
Discriminatory, my fucking ass. The only reason NY isn't getting the vaccine when other states do is strictly because Cuomo wants to have it tested by his "experts" first, which would delay the state's distribution of it. If anybody is being discriminatory it is Cuomo being discriminatory toward President Trump. At the expense of the health of New York's populus. His TDS is that bad. And now he's playing the victim of course.<END_COMMENT>

I mean how absolutely idiotic do people have to be to believe that 70million+ people voted for Donald Trump because they are racist in 2020? No, it can't be because the lefts radical agenda is fucking nuts, or the constant slamming of anyone who dares to question their new world order, or the fact that the left has regarded the billions of dollars in damages from these riots as 'peaceful protest' and 'a summoner of love'. The worst crime of it all is that people are absolutely on board with fighting "Fascism" with real fucking Fascism.

Man, this stuff makes me so angry. But I love that the cops started fighting back hard after this. And the fact the mob waited for lone stragglers before attacking says it all. Cowards.

There are always going to be racist individuals. There is nothing we can do about it. We can't make people change their views on something. It's the other side of the coin when it comes to the freedoms we have. Racism is something to be dealt with, but we put so much effort in an attempt to fully eradicate racism that we miss out on fixing other things. There is so much effort placed on fixing our supposedly racist police force that we don't put any effort into improving the communities that have so much crime. Anymore if you are a conservative you are automatically considered racist, which takes away from actual racists.<END_COMMENT>

Even if somehow blatant wrongdoing is discovered, I'm concerned that nobody will have the resolve to do anything.  Imagine if the election results are overturned, the rioting that is going to happen?  Since last week, we've been commanded to believe that Biden will be president and if you don't you wear a tin foil hat.  The news is all "President Trump's baseless claims".  Will anyone want to stand up to what is going to happen if Trump were to pull off a win?  We're being told "of course Biden won all the mail in, Biden voters CARE about other people."  I feel like I live in alternate reality.  It's hard to believe a man who didn't even campaign, whose only policies are to increase taxes and lock us down will be president.<END_COMMENT>

It's simple. People are starting to see the bullshit of the left. I considered myself more moderate and I didn't even vote Trump in 2016. But as these years have passed by, it's become clear that the left are full of lies and they are very hypocritical. And as much of a jackass as Trump can be sometimes, he has been ruthlessly attacked by the media because he actually is bold enough to call them out. Plus his policies have actually helped America a lot when you dig deeper. And I don't think I'm the only one who's been driven more to the right as a result.<END_COMMENT>
Because your expectation is too low. I expected him to get landslide, only to get robbed by voter fraud.<END_COMMENT>
Polls were always garbage, probably intentionally, and were the only reason people thought Trump would do poorly. And FYI they did not predict massive (suspiciously massive, bigger than Obama) Biden support in Detroit, Philly, Milwaukee, and Atlanta (and only those 4 cities) that would narrowly win him their respective states. They got the calls right there for totally wrong reasons. And they were still way off on the margins.<END_COMMENT>

Really don't understand how believing global warming isn't real is now a Conservative stand point, 99 percent of climate scientists agree, your 'feeling' of what might be real or not, or appeal to your cognitive bias doesn't make it any less true, human activity is exponentially increasing the average temperature of the planet you can look at the data yourself it's all in research journals.<END_COMMENT>

The article states that most monies raised for research were in the form of indirect gifts, meaning that the foundation would solicit donations directly to the companies doing the work.

This whole pandemic has been a weird thing. On one side people think the policy making decisions should just be handed over to "scientists". The problem is these "scientists" and "experts" weren't elected. They only think of the situation from a pure virus standpoint...no other variables, the primary variable being the economic side of things. It's easy for a virus expert to say "Hey we need to shutdown bars and restaurants" because all their little virus models take into account is the virus. It totally disregards the fact that this bar or that restaurant represents a real persons entire life.<END_COMMENT>

As someone who lives in this region, the border security is also a huge issue. I know far, far too many people from RGV who have lost relatives or friends to cartel violence. They might have bought into the "Trump's a racist" rhetoric the first time, but after 4 years they've seen firsthand the proactive, anti-cartel work the current administration is doing and that changes the entire perspective on that issue for them as well.<END_COMMENT>

Meh, all these charities do this. The Clinton foundation does it, trump legal fund is doing it. I never have and never will donate to any of this bullshit.<END_COMMENT>

What matters is whether any vaccine is effective for the vulnerable population.  If it keeps 90% of them from getting covid that's a miracle drug. If it protects 90% of the population, in general, who cares?  99% of people survive without any vaccine at all.<END_COMMENT>

I am starting to come around on the cautious approach of Thanksgiving this year mainly because we are seeing a huge spike in cases.  I think my issue though is the optics of these people saying we're not allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving while they are breaking their own rules.  If we are "all in this together", they need to put a little humanity in what they say and they need to show they are making the same sacrifice.  Knowing some of these democratic governors (Like in Chicago) they just come off as authoritarian and tyrannical.<END_COMMENT>
Spending my 4th straight Thanksgiving alone. Followed by my 5th straight Christmas alone. Yay...<END_COMMENT>
I work at a 911 dispatch center. I have access to a list of all infected people in my state. Its not good. Wear a mask.<END_COMMENT>
Conservative who will not be participating in Thanksgiving this year. I work in an ICU. It would be an act of supreme selfishness.<END_COMMENT>
That number seems way low.  Like 90% of the people around me stopped giving a shit about covid months ago.<END_COMMENT>
If thousands of people can run in the streets celebrating Biden, I can eat turkey with 10 people.<END_COMMENT>
aaaaaaaaaaaaand cases are rising all over the U.S.  We're all idiots, what's new?  It was conservatives that made it a political issue in the first place.  Nobody cared about wearing a mask until Trump made it one and when he says something, 70 million people do as he says no matter what.<END_COMMENT>
Are you serious. Are you guys really that selfish?! I might get banned for saying this but here it goes. First of all I'm a dual national with USA and Australian citizenships and I count my lucky stars everyday I grew up in Australia. The problem is a large portion of my family is over there in the shit rn cause you guys can't seem to make the tiniest little sacrifice like wearing a mask. I see posts about how y'all would fight, die and kill for this country but when ot comes down to it I think that is a total lie you tell yourself to justify carrying a gun and feeling like a big man. Cause when your asked to make the smallest sacrifices like being a little uncomfortable you throw a tantrum. Now I know it's not all those who identify as conservative, my entire family and pretty much they're entire friend groups are cons and I get along just fine with all of them. But there is still a big enough portion of you to really do some damage. I call my grandma every day cause I'm terrified she'll get sick and you guys seem to be laughing at this pandemic like it hasn't killed 250000 people already. I don't understand why you can't just be an empathetic person and try to help your fellow Americans by putting on a mask and social distancing it actually works as shown by Australia cause we don't have many cases anymore. The worst hit state just went 16 days without a new case. Again I don't mean to attack anyone I'm just scared for my family and seeing some of the comments making light of this situation really got my angry<END_COMMENT>

There is no agenda for the GOP if Trump doesn't pull this off.

For everyone saying that masks work and we wouldn't have to lockdown if we wore them, I'm currently an expat in France and we've had to go back into lockdown after months of mask mandates.<END_COMMENT>
The point of the lockdown was to allow the hospital's to get ahead of the influx of patients.  It was also happening to allow the government to set up contact tracing. This would have prevented the country from being locked down for so long. Unfortunately the Government did none of the the steps to mitigate the spread. Unlike other countries that was contract tracing. By tracing the contact between people they were able to  tamp down hot spots.<END_COMMENT>
For a dose of reality, visit /r/Unemployment<END_COMMENT>

Fascists Stomp on Trump Supporters Head**<END_COMMENT>

I'm a patient person, but this tick tocking is getting annoying.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah. I dunno. Seeing lots of talk and promises. They better back it up<END_COMMENT>
Enough fucking talk!! Do it. We have one month before  the votes are certified, tired of all this bullshit chest beating<END_COMMENT>
I want to believe, but this article was posted yesterday and I still see no Kraken.<END_COMMENT>
so then do it, stop tick tocking us<END_COMMENT>
It's interesting comparing the posts here to r/politics. I'd really like to see proof of the fraud. There are plenty of red flags, but it's getting harder to believe we will get any proof.<END_COMMENT>
I like the analogy Dave Rubin recently used. Trump's presidency has been like a video game, and now he is facing "the boss", the main, most powerful villain in the game. It seems he has lost all his weapons and he has no chances. He seems ill prepared to meet the master. But, he talks the talk. Soon, we'll find out whether he can walk the walk. For the sake of US democracy, and the whole free world, I hope he manages to expose the truth. Because the way all MSM and Social Media, all of a sudden, got so defensive about election fraud, is a huge red flag. If there was no merit to these accusations, they would let play this out like they always have in the past.<END_COMMENT>
And people said the election was over. Little do they know, Trump is the real winner.<END_COMMENT>
Yet Trump somehow "lost" the election. This just doesn't add up. I get that there's a lot of people that wanted trump out of the office but for joe Biden to have over 78 million votes is just strange.<END_COMMENT>
Hmmm. And they still lost the election? Makes you think<END_COMMENT>
Always remember their first call of the election night was that Dems wouldn't lose any seats in the house.  Don't think that this was by accident.  They are becoming part of the propaganda machine and lost all credibility with me.  **I will never watch them again**.<END_COMMENT>

Put the hypocrisy aside for a minute and consider this.  Remember morons like this scare the shit out of the idiot citizen by telling them how they are all going to die from this virus.

our nevada governor preaches the same hypocrisy.      he had a halloween party at his house with 200 people none of whom wore masks.     Karma did catch him though as he tested positive for wuhan yesterday.<END_COMMENT>

They really are the party of petulant children<END_COMMENT>
LOL.. that dailywire article is super manipulative.  The first video is of the MAGA supporter getting knocked out.  Under that, they link a longer video with "more context" where the MAGA supporter is going around attacking people, until someone finally comes along and clocks him.  This sort of news manipulation happens on both sides to rile up otherwise rational people, and I'm sick of it.  How do we get back to holding these sites accountable for blatantly lying so each side can score points?<END_COMMENT>
Yeah its a big problem when the only thing you have going for you is "I'm not Trump".<END_COMMENT>
So ashamed in my state of Minnesota for voting this clown<END_COMMENT>

So does this mean that if Biden does actually become President, all of the shortcomings would be Trump's fault but anything positive would be Biden's doing?<END_COMMENT>
No one can defend why they voted for Biden; to not vote Trump is not why we do these elections.<END_COMMENT>
Their whole campaign was literally anti-Trump more than actual policies.<END_COMMENT>
So many flat out *stupid* voters. Voting for someone based on their personality makes you certifiably autistic.<END_COMMENT>
This was obvious based on how he campaigned. He literally hid half the election in his basement. The more he spoke the more support he lost. He had to hope anti Trump sentiment would carry him.<END_COMMENT>

I remember Bush, Romney, McCain... pretty much every Republican of note in my lifetime, has been called a Nazi. It's basically just a meaningless slur at this point.<END_COMMENT>

How about just focusing on the abandonment of journalism? Why do facts need to be filtered through a political ideology machine?

His policies are spot-on, and he's a fighter. I voted for him and I support him. But I'm also mad that he couldn't be cool at a crucial time when early votes were being mailed and people just _couldn't_ vote for bad behavior, e.g., his actions after treatment for the virus (i groaned aloud when he removed his mask to walk into the White House) and crazy tweets. I emailed the White House so many times expressing support but begging for more discretion in the tweets and off-the-cuff remarks. A little more self-control and he could've had it.<END_COMMENT>

Washington, at the state level, is a perfect example of why a national Electoral college is necessary. I'm born in raised in Central Wa, and our wants, needs and values are constantly trampled and overrun by the leftist heart of King, Pierce and Snohomish county. While people point to the the amount of tax dollars that leave those counties, they ignore that they come to our areas as a "playground" disrespect the trails and lakes, and buy up all of the housing as vacation homes. My hometown, now has a median home cost of $375k, with over 50% of the work being in agriculture. They leave those areas, and vote in the same representatives that enforce these backwards policies. Unfortunately this is forcing us out of the area our families have been for generations, because we simply cannot afford to raise a family here.<END_COMMENT>

What's frightening is that 95.4% would still be okay with it even after four years of screeching about "Russian collusion" that amounted to nothing.<END_COMMENT>

Is any of this surprising? CNN has been bashing on Trump even before he was elected. They spout opinions as fact with no supporting information. To hell with CNN!<END_COMMENT>
Let's be honest, no matter what evidence exists, the swamp creatures on both sides of the aisle will prevent Trump winning.  I hate to say that, but I'm looking at prior precedent.  These same creatures protected Hillary during the Benghazi hearings as well as the bathroom server incident.  They allowed a fake dossier to initiate an investigation.

Andrew yang actually has some good ideas but too bad, his race kept him off the spotlight.<END_COMMENT>
Sooo by Summer 21... Kamala will be president?<END_COMMENT>
I give him 2 years as President tops. The Dems might try to keep him until the midterms to try and keep the Dems from getting utterly destroyed during the midterms with Kamala Harris as president<END_COMMENT>
People got mad at her for opposing sex trafficking. This shit's absurd.<END_COMMENT>
Oh the magic bad word appeared. Christian. Anybody associated with Hollywood cannot bear to have themselves associated with that kind of rabble. How dare someone be against killing unborn babies. Pffftt.<END_COMMENT>
So one can assume that she is supportive of sex traffickers. Well looking at that picture she can rest assured that she will never be targeted by sex traffickers.<END_COMMENT>

Anyone who thinks a win would be "easy" is hopelessly naive<END_COMMENT>
All of these ideas sound good. I'm amazed that we have yet to hear real fraud found and exposed yet. Theres so many possibilities that keep popping up. Like Trump said we just need a few weeks. Hopefully we have enough time.<END_COMMENT>
More like Democrats *learned that* Dominion voting machines *could be used* to switch votes. This was more of an a-ha than an oh shit for them.<END_COMMENT>
Ok...now show us proof votes were flipped...someone saying something is not proof or evidence.<END_COMMENT>
What i learned this past week.....If you want proof of a fair election ... you're being a baby and a sore loser. Interesting hmmmmm<END_COMMENT>

 Cuomo is bent out of shape because the vaccine announced is still under Trump administration. And wants it to wait to distribute it when Biden is put in (and yeah fat chance of that happening...there will be no Commander-In-Thief).<END_COMMENT>

After WWII, the US intelligence agencies constructed a fine living for themselves. Over time they felt they were smart enough to be king makers. At this point I've seen enough to mistrust most of the intelligence alphabet agencies.<END_COMMENT>

Where is Biden with that unity speech. They got him the votes why isnt he condemning them now.<END_COMMENT>
I was there, it was totally peaceful in the day. Kids and families and dogs. It was like Disney world. Proud boys were there in the day and were also peaceful. Antifa showed up but was so overwhelmed in numbers the police had to protect them. Most people, including me, left at 4 when the event officially ended. Apparently Antifa returned to take on a smaller crowd.<END_COMMENT>

I love the new black Republicans who have run for office. Hopefully more minority Republicans will run for offices. Many minorities are conservatives in values. They have just been brainwashed to believe Republicans are racists.<END_COMMENT>
Nice. I think we will take back the house in 2022.<END_COMMENT>
Hell yeah! Proud to have voted for him.<END_COMMENT>
If not for fraud, I bet more House seats went to the GOP<END_COMMENT>
This comment might get down voted on this sub and on r/politics but its true I think and its been true for awhile now. On the whole and on the national level, Americans want divided government.<END_COMMENT>
Because they don't want to end this dystopian lockdown.  It's going to continue long after there is a vaccine.  The lockdown will continue until the infection numbers of zero.  The lockdown will continue because it is cold a flu season and best not to risk anything.  The lockdown will continue because there are anti-Lockdown demonstrators demanding an end to the lockdown.  The lockdown is continuing because it's for your own safety.<END_COMMENT>

They stole it from her in 2018, glad to see she stomped them this time around<END_COMMENT>
It's absolutely awsome to see her get the seat. These next 4 years there should be a huge initiative to give the Republican women and people of color a sh*tton of exposure. We could do wonders if we could get younger and more diverse republicans speaking at colleges and talking to the younger crowd. The dems have a massive ground game and we should definitely kick the crap out of it.<END_COMMENT>
I'm going to guess California is going to redraw these districts to divide and conquer these pesky conservative Koreans and Vietnamese.<END_COMMENT>
This call is a great birthday present! So glad to see Kim take back the district I grew up in and another Asian Republican headed to Congress!<END_COMMENT>
Nice. Second Korean GOP elected for the house this cycle.<END_COMMENT>
10th flipped seat today thanks everyone ;)<END_COMMENT>
I really hope we can flip the House in 2022<END_COMMENT>
I can say I saw more signs for her in my county than her opponent. Her supporters really cane out.<END_COMMENT>
They are doing the recount with the observers locked in a corner of the room lmao.<END_COMMENT>
The "will of the people" is a popular vote, which still sees Trump losing, he lost the popular vote last election too. If you think that having to lean on the electoral college and lawsuits to win every election is the "will of the people" thats a bit delusional.<END_COMMENT>
Prove that it was stolen first<END_COMMENT>
But will the state legislative bodies actually follow through....sorry, but I won't hold my breath on this happening.<END_COMMENT>
Good thing it wasn't stolen, then, and the will of the majority of people is still represented.<END_COMMENT>
The brigading going on right now is outrageous. Mods?<END_COMMENT>

We should let the lottery run the election<END_COMMENT>
Republicans are far from cowardly. If by cowardly we don't march the streets and riot while destroying other people's property, then we are indeed cowards. We take our problems to the court and not to the streets. That's how we do things.<END_COMMENT>

The side of him the media refuses to show.<END_COMMENT>

We cannot do this again. A "pause" will do nothing. We are already doing everything we can do within reason to stop Covid and its still here. Perhaps that should tell us something.<END_COMMENT>

How many more "accidents" are going to keep getting discovered? Is anything actually going to happen?<END_COMMENT>
So broken chain of custody? Everything on that flash drive should be invalidated.<END_COMMENT>
Anything could have happened to this flash drive while it was off the grid. It should be handed over to military intelligence.<END_COMMENT>
And what are the odds of this actually happening?<END_COMMENT>
Wait, so if this law suit is successful wouldnt that flip Wisconsin for trump? That's a huge amount of votes.  Or am I reading the headline wrong?<END_COMMENT>
I really feel like some people are grasping at straws if they think 800k votes in a state are being invalidated.<END_COMMENT>
If we disenfranchise enough people, we can maybe win!<END_COMMENT>
This lawsuit is probably more of a long shot. What's not is challenging the fact that Wisconsin allows clerks and election officials to determine voter intent if it isn't clear and also that they allow clerks to fill in witness address info if it isn't on the ballot already<END_COMMENT>
That girl will never vote Democrat for the rest of her life.  Thanks, Antifa.  You girl-attacking cunts.<END_COMMENT>

The best part about having different states is that we can see repeats of every authoritarian socialist regime throughout history playing out at the same time. Whether you want to watch Stalin 2.0 in California or Hitler 2.0 in New York, there's fun for lovers of every historical era!<END_COMMENT>

I know this is satire, but that is the exact thing that they used to try to provide to each citizen in the old USSR. The thing about that is that they never even came close to reaching that goal.<END_COMMENT>

the idea of white privilege seems to throw diversity out of the window<END_COMMENT>
It's racist to rely on stereotypes when you have contradictory personal evidence available, absolutely. The left critical theorist types use these terms as weapons, despite the fact that they prise apart the racial divide. Why exactly do they think that attacking Western White majorities for their race will do anything but consolidate them into hostile conservative blocks?<END_COMMENT>
And this is why you throw a middle finger to the air and go about your business like a free person regardless.<END_COMMENT>

Why are there so many pro-trump and conservative comments getting downvoted today?<END_COMMENT>
So Biden is getting the same "landslide" 306 vote victory that Trump did in 2016?  That's an amusing coincidence.<END_COMMENT>
Hey guys, here's how Bernie can still win!<END_COMMENT>
Good for him he still lost<END_COMMENT>
Still doesn't matter biden is well over 270 and no amount of temper tantrums from trump will change that<END_COMMENT>
He still lost. Deal with it.<END_COMMENT>
You guys are so fucking delusional, I'm starting to actually feel sad for you.<END_COMMENT>
The fact that he actually has the license plates is huge news<END_COMMENT>
The headline says "after the midnight deadline" while he says "after the 8PM deadline" and then there's mention of it being the first drop since 10:30PM as if it was normal.<END_COMMENT>
The deadline was not for "delivery" of ballots, it was for casting and dropping them into a drop box... This is completely normal and happened all over the US. It is a standard part of every election.<END_COMMENT>
I like how the true root of this, is people are upset that votes are being counted. I personally dont think it should matter if they arrived a day late. Its still what that person wanted, we shouldve extended this voting period to ensure even more people were able to make sure their voices are heard. Isnt what we want ultimately EVERY citizen having their voice heard? or only when it favors our side? I am not a fan of trump, but when he won the election I wished the best for him because he was my president, I genuinely dont understand this temper tantrum from the people wanting votes NOT counted when they represent an americans voice. I definitely understand the people who are worried of fraud (actual fraud, not a ballot arriving late)but there has been no evidence of it being widespread, or anything that would sway the direction of the election.<END_COMMENT>
Weird how none of this holds up in court.<END_COMMENT>
Of course. I can promise you that these states didn't randomly decide to stop counting ballots at 10 and 11pm for no reason. There was absolutely zero excuse for it taking so long and not even attempting to continue counting. The more the count gets drawn out the easier it is to sneak things in<END_COMMENT>
I care more about secure elections than his re-election at this point. That shit is bad for EVERYONE.<END_COMMENT>
