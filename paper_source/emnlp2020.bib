    abstract = "In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

  optabstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be
jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the
(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},
