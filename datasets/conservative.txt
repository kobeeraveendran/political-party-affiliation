I hope y'all are cooler than the bitches on r/politics. Just got banned from it for bringing up the Hunter Biden and media blackout bs.Edit: I did call anyone cheering on the censorship "bootlickers"....and apparently the snowflake Mods didnt like it.
Can I join if i'm not a conservative, just done with liberals?
R/conservatives, for when you are terrified of the public being able to post to your content.
Hey, I was banned from this discord. Not sure if there was a misunderstanding.... the only thing I ever talked about was about shitty public school systems and propaganda i was given as a large assignmentEdit #1 no one else in my family uses discord
Funny how no one gives a shit about medical announcements unless its something like "Trump can now kiss kids" again.Please stop selectively listening to experts, listen to them all the time.
>just done with liberalsI felt the same way after being in r/politics for 2 mins
We do not have the same limitations as on Reddit, so people of all political beliefs are welcome to the Discord. There are private areas only for verified conservatives as well (if you have flair here just PM a Discord moderator to get into them).
Interestingly enough,  I've been banned from a number of the major subreddits due to their fear of having opposing viewpoints
Absolutely also best flair good job
If you don't we don't have your username and as such we can't ban you. Basically you have some other issue.Try this URL: discord.gg/conservative
Proof I know you're not on the server, because it's not like that at all.
It's r/lgbt and r/arethestraightsOK for me
I am not even American, but would like to immigrate to the U.S. (legally, of course), and agree with your suggestion
Thank you! Feel free to copy it. The more the merrier.
User has been banned from this guild...
Jesus that second sub is cancer. Not sure how that isn't considered hate. Even more not sure why I looked there.
Show proof or gtfo. This is the stupidest thing lefties believe. That the right (conservatives) supports genocide. You are delusional. Get help.
Who voted these idiots into office?  Citizens of Minneapolis need to engage and vote these morons out.  Voting matters.
Are ACAB people that dumb, what did they expect when the police was no more. For crime to disappear?
In a city that already had a high crime rate what did they think would happen when they defunded the police and the media gave people excuses to commit crimes?
I can see the apologists now, "These were 'mostly law abiding' criminals".Or how about this one, taken from the pages of common sense gun control: "These measures only work if we implement them everywhere, most of these criminals were from other towns where the police hadn't yet been defunded."And my personal favorite, "This wasn't REAL police defunding, that hasn't been tried yet."
Cause and effect analysis is clearly racist and to suggest otherwise is mansplaining.
No one is going to want to be a cop in that damn city now lol
Its almost like the police are an integral part of our society or something...
Cops: You could not live with your failure, and where did that bring you? BACK TO ME!
Minneapolis just voted today to cut another 5.9 million off the police budget.
Thank You Minneapolis for performing this study, unfortunately the only people paying attention to it are the ones who already knew what was going to happen, so a few more cities are going to have to perform this study before the results actually start being noticed
The circle of life for leftist ideas.
"Well guys, I mean, we at least need the police so we can arrest families for having Thanksgiving dinner, right?"
Well Seattle recently lost a social worker to some guy who came into their office and stabbed her to death
Call in the social workers, they sure will be the first go into a dangerous situation w/o and armor or weapons.
I fucking love the Left.  You can't make this stuff up.
Good luck with that.Used to live in Minneapolis.*Used to*
Could you imagine if they had a conservative in the room to act as the brakes?Like instead of crafting and passing legislation within a month of the Floyd memorial riots, they came out and said > Look.  We're going to restructure law enforcement, but these things take time.  That's just how bureaucracy works.  We're working to fix things, but it's not going to be overnight.  We'll keep you updated with bi-monthly progress reports.  This is a two way street and you have to give us time to get it right on the first try.And then maybe a slow transition from outright law enforcement to community outreach efforts from police departments to build good will with the people.But no.  May, Floyd dies and June they pass hot garbage, and September they're shocked that it failed miserably.
Most Minneapolis residents are tripping over themselves to try to prove they're part of the progressive crowd. The city council will likely only get more progressive. This is also why Ilhan Omar isn't going anywhere. (I'm a resident...which may need to change soon.)
People immigrating from other states and countries. As the true Minnesotans sell their houses and move out of the city.It's been happening for more than a decade. Hennepin and Ramsey County have been constantly going to shit.
Not happening. I'm from far SE MN. I visited a buddy who lives 3 blocks from the Floyd killing. That whole city had a hopeless, miserable feel. Which is new. Grody ass liberal political signs rampant. It is no coincidence. Outstate MN is nothing at all like that blue, blue city.
Voting doesn't matter because its riffled with fraud
They got what they wanted!  Jesus Christ, Dems are so delusional and naive.  I think it's hilarious, but I feel sorry for the people, that live there,  that didn't vote for these idiots.
It was a peaceful couple of violent months.
Exactly this.  It isn't as simple as "re-funding the police" now.  You spent a year demonizing the police, supporting prosecution of officers for being present while someone overdosed from drugs he took before he was in custody, and then removed funding from the police department.If you say "oops, here's your old budget back, hire some more police to replace the ones who left", you're going to end up with a lot of unused budget money at the end of the year.  Nobody wants to start being a police officer in Minneapolis now.
But you can vote it out
Yes, they think there is psychological conditioning going  which somehow leads to higher crime - place cops in schools, people start to act like criminals.It will require a full generation or more of experimentation with defunding the police before it can be shown whether their hypothesis works or not, because you can't expect people to recover from the ongoing trauma of life in 21st century USA straight away.Of course, it won't work and any city that stuck to the principle would lose all of their middle class residents as they flee the rushing wave of crime, leaving a burnt out post-apocalyptic shell, but the fantasy remains alluring.
AOC, when asked what a city would look like without police, she said "like a suburb."Her logic was that police cause crime and you only see police in heavily black areas because of racism. Racism brings police to the area, and then police presence causes crime. The suburbs don't have that problem because police aren't patrolling the suburbs.Except...the police are there in those areas because they're high crime areas. The police aren't patrolling the suburbs because the people who live in suburbs don't give police a reason to patrol like that. They're not committing crimes en masse like these inner cities are.Her logic is so twisted. I don't know how people reach those conclusions, but here we are.
Here's what happened: Research showed that **bad** policing (IE sending people to hard prison for carrying weed) increases crime. This makes sense; if you make felons out of otherwise productive members of society then they are much more likely to continue committing crimes Now, a moron who has been coddled all their life would see this research and conclude that decreasing police would decrease crime. They don't realize that there are violent criminals who are just waiting for an opportunity to murder, rape, and steal. They've never been exposed to itWhat has been showing to work is **more police** and **less prisons**. Target the violent fuckers and serve the productive members of society. Stop locking them up for nothing
I forgot who said it, maybe shapiro, but it was along the lines of "there isnt a lot of crime because there a lot of cops. Theres a lot of cops because there is a lot of crime. That would be like saying the reason California has so many wildfires is because there are too many fire fighters."
Do you think Dems think ahead? There is a reason teens and know nothing college kids overwhelmingly support dems.
For real, the country is full of idiots, but atleast were spaced out cant cause any real harm. Pack them all into a city council hall and.. well...
As well as statistics. Those are not ok and a symptom and byproduct of a racist time.
I mean, there's got to be a TON of social worker positions open though, right?
It's also difficult to unanimously support a police department when it's not properly functioning to begin with.
I believe humans aren't fit to be packed into a city like they are, in a biological and/or psychological sense.  It is the source of all the hate and crime in large cities.A lot of people talk about the terrible conditions in the inner city, when the answer is to just move out, go to a smaller metropolitan area where these problems don't exist.  And yes, it is as easy as that.  There is a reason why the left is a party of hate.
If you don't mind me asking, where did you move to? I'm seriously thinking Hudson. Just need to get out of this goddamned state altogether.
Yeah I posted my own but ill add to this. Mn is a prime counter example when libs try to complain about gerrymandering, the twin cities and Duluth rule our big elections. You will find that MN is an awesome state actually if you explore but most people just visit those places.
White Flight will soon be illegal.
I have to agree. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
Sensible, level headed, adult decision making is not what modern activism is about. It's about fly by the seat of your pants and fox things as you fuck them up based on poorly marketed slogans
This is the scariest part about leftists imo. So many of them know they're wrong and that their policies hurt them but that doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is being woke and "progressive".
Yeah I was just saying this about Chicago too.  Lotta people bailing on that city.  Rough times ahead.
Most of them are just plain stupid
The rioters mostly come at night... mostly.
But Dominion can keep them voted in!
Eh i wouldnt count on it. The dnc is very skilled at convincing low iq/low information voters to show up in droves
We already have enough, thank you very much....
And, of course, when that happens, they'll blame racism and republicans.
It's racist white liberals who think that way though. Actual poor black people who live in these crime-ridden communities not only don't want police defunded, they want more police in their neighborhoods. Liberal white knights are here to save them though to show them they are wrong to want more police.
This was a whole trend on social media. A song that went something like "of course black neighborhoods have higher rates of crimes, they are over policed!"
And remember what kamala harris said about them. They're stupid and make really bad decisions.
Isn't this what they wanted? Defund the police? What did they think would happen?
>Officers all over the country are getting punished for one guy in Minnesotas actions. It's almost as if people are stereotyping all cops based on the actions of a few lol
Fort Worth, TX.I have many friends that live in western WI and commute into town though. Popular thing to do.Export that MN money!
I personally moved out to Carver County. No need to be out of state (especially when you work in the west metro for me personally) when you can just leave the county.
My parents moved to Wisconsin. I'm considering South Dakota, Tennessee, and Florida in the future.
It's crazy how the Founders of this country foresaw people having knee-jerk reactions to events and then purposely set up our system to be difficult for people like that to change it on a whim. Unfortunately, every year these idiots are removing these safeguards so we get 'iNsTaNt JuStIcE' instead of rational response and debate before making a drastic alteration.
It's nothing new.  It's not like the people in the leftist model states of the USSR and North Korea believe the bullshit they are forced to swallow.  They just fear the consequences of wrongthink.
Maybe if your movement wanted additional funding for better police training and/or adding social workers they should have used a different saying than "defund the police" as that is exactly what they didn't want.
I am paraphrasing the language of academic progressives
Considering this is a New Mexican college student, yes.
Because it's feelings over facts in their world. They are trained to feel bad at perceived injustices and then taught to parrot talking points fed to them to fight for justice.
I'm not trying to be rude to you and I agree we need to find a reasonable solution. But if Minneapolis' residents want to defer to the most hysterical, knee-jerk reactionaries and cop-hating babies to make their decisions, I have zero sympathy. I don't live there, so it's really none of my business anyway. Wishing them the best of luck.
Follow Up Headline: "All Attempts to Stop John Adams from Spinning Have Failed"
I'm glad they kept the wig on for the burial. Just in case we forgot who he was.
I wonder if they voted for Biden, though.
CNN: conservatives are now digging up graves and harassing the dead
You have it all wrong... This is the answer to our clean energy needs , just strap the founding fathers to some generators  and that spin can be harnessed to power the entire country
I have an idea, hook them up to a rotor and stator... UNLIMITED POWER.
Imagine thinking the founding fathers are turning in their graves because of Biden and not trump undermining our whole democratic process and institutions that the founders themselves set up.
ugh,  babylon bee is a try hard.
Well they certainly predicted a horribly corrupt Trump-like cult figure:> They should look forward to a time, and that not a distant one, when a corruption in this, as in the country from which we derive our origin, will have seized the heads of government, and be spread by them through the body of the people.> The time to guard against corruption and tyranny, is before they shall have gotten hold of us. It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold, than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he shall have entered.
These babylon bee articles make this sub look fucking stupid.
Well, they already would have been spinning from Black and LGBTQ rights
Maybe they can harvest his rotations as green energy?
I know this sounds not believable but I'm actually related to John adams. My family has multiple copies of books of our family tree that has been passed down through the generations starting in 1470, up to present day, and I've actually had it confirmed by experts that the writing in the book of his to show what he does are in fact his writing. Everyone writes a description of what their life is like and what they do in it. It's hundred of pages long at this point.
Oh come on, that was funny.
#TELL THEM SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!!!
I think you discovered the true goal of the Left and the Green New Deal.
I absolutely intentionally bought GOYA products around that time when that happened. Will continue to buy from them.
That's hilarious.  I have Goya products in my pantry right now.  I'll have to remember this and definitely continue buying their products.
My mom always loved Goya products and so I've always loved them as well, but would stray from time to time.  Now it's strictly Goya in this household.Edit. Misspelling
awww heck, don't forget to break out the cornbread.
I feel the need to do my Texas duty and point out that chili doesn't have beans in it. And I'm risking capital punishment here, but I actually prefer my chili with beans added. My cabinets are well stocked with Goya black beans for this purpose. May God protect me.
GOYA CEO is pro Trump. AOC called for a boycott of GOYA. It backfired and only served as a free marketing for GOYA.
And for dessert, their Maria cookies.
I'm from Texas, you are correct, no beans in Texas chili. Black beans and rice are a staple in our house.
How dare you. To the guillotine!/s
Yeah beans in chilli still tastes so good
They also have a flan that is to die for!!!
Goya products have always been in my pantry and always will be, AOC can suck it!!!!
Regardless of guilt, this was probably her best option honestly. With how important this is, saying anything at all without a lawyer is stupid.
Supposedly she's had fraud charges in the past. Kind of surprising they let people like that run our elections.
She is not the mastermind behind all this. Still, would have been a glorious shitshow if she actually showed up to that interview.
They need to be put into protective custody.
Should be charged with election fraud
I'd secure bodyguards you know the left doesn't leave witnesses
Her daughter is involved as well.  I'd be leaning on that angle pretty hard to get the details.
She will have a nice Soros-purchased lawyer.
There's no probably about it. She did the smart thing here it shouldn't shock anybody.
This. Securing an attorney in this situation is the only move to make.
Yeah ngl lawyering up is not any kind of admission of guilt. It's just a smart move on her part, on its face.
Yep, the more high profile, more legal quandaries, the more important it is to have a lawyer present.Something like this 100% should have legal counsel and legal advice before proceeding with an interview or anything that could implicate anything.
I wonder who is paying for the legal counsel, and who the legal counsel is.That might tell a story in itself.
Holy Cow. I knew about the prior fraud charges but your comment made me even question how she got the job. Is a background check not required for this type of role?
> Supposedly she's had fraud charges in the past. Kinda of surprising they let people like that run our elections.When the democrats decide to rig an election they want to use experienced experts
I looked it up.  Personally I don't think it's the same Ruby Freeman.  She doesn't look like the same person, plus if the age and booking date on it were correct, she would only be 44 today, and I think the election rigger is in her 60s.That said, if she's rigging elections now, I doubt it's the first time she's committed fraud of some kind, whether she was caught or not.
If she was convicted of fraud, I'd question the hiring process of that local government.
Well, in some cities, the election workers are not even fully literate.
Charges do not equal conviction. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.But I'm not going to put any bets on how rigorous the investigation into the charges was. You can't prove what you don't investigate.
Makes sense to me. When you want to commit a fraud, go with the seasoned professionals.The video of the post-stop counts and hidden ballot cases combined with the video or the woman processing piles of ballots with no return address makes it pretty obvious what was going on in Fulton County - and why they will **never** allow scrutiny of those ballot envelopes in Atlanta.
One of these mental midgets will flip with even the slightest pressure applied. They need to start putting them in bracelets and perp walking them for all to see. Too many people know what happened and one of them will crumble.
I got money says if its not kemp or Raffensperger, its linked to blm/soros
Not a chance she will even be charged.  We no longer have equal justice and we should get used to it.
Yes, for our sake if not their own.
How about civil rights violations charges?  It works for getting past "double jeopardy" for cops.
> I'd secure bodyguards you know the left doesn't leave witnessesThe democrats are like the Mob and the CIA.....always kill the assassins.
Her daughter is the one who told people to go home, and placed the table at 8:22 in the morning where the ballots in question were kept, and is vid of her exceedingly suspiciously palming what appears to be a USB drive from Ruby
> The ballots were scanned, not "counted" -- a process done before the ballots were officially countedThose were tabulator machines. The scanning process *is* the counting process.> They were not suitcases, they were cases marked with tags and stickers to easily identifyThat's a fallacy fallacy argument. It doesn't matter what container those ballots were in. What matters is all of the *other* circumstances. Where they were, when they were opened, and who was around when they were pulled out from their hiding place.> If ballots are pulled out with witnesses around, they have to be scanned to prevent fraud"Witnesses" being people who *are not* election workers. Everyone in that room at the time was an election worker. There were no "witnesses" from the public, press, or campaigns present when these specific four boxes were opened.
You would be an absolute idiot not to secure legal counsel here, especially if someone told you to scan these ballots after hours. I am sure whoever her bosses are told her to handle them in this manner.
These charges show she was experienced in the job she was hired for.
Consider that being willing to commit fraud may have been a prerequisite?
They DID do a background check. All honest people were not hired. lol.
We all know *why* she got the job.  Some truly evil people had a plan, and she was willing to take the reigns of said plan.  This shit is truly scary.  I have zero confidence in our democracy at this point with people like Ruby and her fucking daughter in charge of things in a critical county in a swing state.  This entire election is preposterous.
Thats the difference. I'm all for bringing this to light. But just being charged doesn't make you guilty. After all if that was the case, President Trump could never have even run for office. If she as actually convicted, then the issue about faces and becomes insanely disturbung.
Public education has been such a success....
That's the big difference here that I don't know why people seem to keep ignoring. People have signed sworn affidavits. If they are lying, they can be charged with filing false statements. These aren't people just making claims on social media. They are making actual legal accusations that carry with them penalties for lying. Far more than muh Russia ever had as far as evidence and witnesses.
They want you to just get used to it. Don't.
I'm sure the spineless governor will pardon anyone found to have committed crimes "so we can put this behind us and begin healing".
>We no longer have equal justice and we should get used to it.You do you...
> We no longer have equal justice and we should get used to it.Abso-fucking-lutely not, thank you.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
>Why not continue counting the ballots left over in the boxes and on the tables?They eventually did. At 10pm employees placed open ballots back into the secure containers ("suitcases", as Trump loyalists are calling them) to protect them from fraud. The media was there during this.And then shortly after, the counting resumed and the opened ballots were pulled out of the containers to be officially counted.
Not really, I'd want to hire the person who didn't get caught.
Which is particularly nuts if you think about it considering that means it really only checks what you did last election cycle... potentially allowing cheater to participate every other election assuming they were actually caught every time.
Just didn't get caught during that time.
Like any good criminal, she learned from her mistakes to not get caught until now.
If she did 100 and got caught only on 1, that is an expert
When you catch someone stealing or cheating, it's probably not the first time they've done that lol.
Just wait till the next batch, the new remote-educated are unleashed on society.
> And the pole watcher themself admits to NOT being there for an hour of their countingSo?
I said she was experienced. I didn't say she was competent.
This. Even the pros don't bat .1000!
Notice teachers unions complete silence on the fact that black children are rapidly falling behind others due to the lockdowns.Except where they try to block parents creating their own teaching circles.  They don't want anyone but them indoctrinating students.
The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Twitter and Facebook reminded him that they do read and record his private messages on their "platforms".
I thought that this was the "Kraken"...
I'm not an expert in law, but it seems to me that these quick dismissals are not good news. Are the courts refusing to hear these cases due to a lack of apparent evidence, or is there some other thing going on with how the judicial system works?
The Federalist had an article a week ago on how a court case in Nevada that week would finally present the evidence in court. It went ahead and the case was dismissed with a whimper from the media, left or right.I highly doubt that Trump has any shot. Especially with the college voting in a week.
Basically, the judge said there measures in Michigan state law for challenging an election result. Trump et al did not do that. Powell instead filed in a federal court to try to say there are problems in the state election, which isn't the federal court's jurisdiction. Even if it was true, the federal court couldn't do anything. It would have to be brought in state court.
None of this is a serious legal challenge. It's about money.The longer it goes on, the more donations to Trumps "legal fund".75% of this fund goes directly to Trump Corp.(The other 25c goes to Ghouliani and co salaries, to try to keep it going.)It's just Trump University 2.0
Essentially slim technicalities, no judge wants to be the one who overturns a state vote. Especially because everyone knows this is headed to SCOTUS
Good. Nice and quick so it can make its way through appeals.
Could have done voter reform.  Could have allowed states to start counting mail-in-votes prior to election day.
You don't have to be a leftist to recognize that most of these cases are garbage and it has become exceedingly unlikely that there is evidence of widespread fraud that would change the outcome of the election.
We're not leftists. It's just that there's a substantial number of us conservatives that don't support Trump's obvious falsehoods.
If you see any users with a history of left wing posts, send a message in to mod mail. You may not get a response directly but they will be reviewed. Our system is not impervious to bad actors and we rely on users like you to report them.
I know what's gonna happen. Biden will be confirmed as President.
Is he saying it needs to go through the state first?
Again, I am just looking for answers... Other than the obvious weight of the situation, how do we know it is headed to the SCOTUS? What needs to happen before any of these cases can be heard there?
>Essentially slim technicalitiesThat's not at all consistent with the [court's opinion.] Powell's lawsuit was dismissed because it was without merit on multiple fronts, basic issues like mootness, standing, etc. And it wasn't just the technical issues - the Judge also analyzed the merits of the lawsuit and found the specific allegations were "nothing but speculation and conjecture." These lawsuits were doomed to fail the moment they were filed. There's no case or controversy sufficient to warrant review by SCOTUS.
Nothing is going to SCOTUS. This crack pot is taking you for a ride.
Right. Except in PA, the PASC ruled that you have no standing if the injury/crime hasn't occurred yet. &#x200B;Almost like you lose both ways, and unconstitutional actions by your executive or legislature won't be stopped by your judiciary. Weird, huh?
Fear? I voted for Trump lmfaoThe difference here being: I'm not delusional or a Trump Loyalist
So Doc, what are you going to do when they swear in Biden?
Flair has nothing to do with seeing reality.
Agreed. And more importantly, President Trump has never been particularly conservative. This isn't /r/the_donald, President Trump's increasingly desperate attempts to cling to power, either to avoid debt, prosecution, or the image of losing is simply not important to me as a conservative.
Pretty much. If there is fraud, file in the state court, and it will remedy it as state law provides. There's no reason for this to be a federal issue at all.
Appeal the the 11th Circuit, then SCOTUS. Biggest challenge isn't getting there but is the stalling by the court since everything is time sensitive.
If it's appealed, all they can decide on is whether this dismissal is proper. Even if it was overturned on appeal, it would then have to be sent back down and this same court would have to try it again.
Probably claim to have a disease and Resign
democrats against democrats? Are you off your meds this morn?
The deadline for elector certification is December 23rd.
Congress counts the electoral votes on Jan 6th, which happens after the president of the senate receives the electoral vote certificates on Dec 23rd, which happens after the electors cast their ballots on dec 14th
So are you going to do anything?
Do you need a reminder for when Biden is sworn in?
It's fraud in the state election of electors. The electoral college is weird. It's actually not a strictly federal election.
Brooks requires a Senator to cosign the complaint (to my knowledge, none have agreed to) and then the House and Senate must separately vote and agree to dismiss the electors.  The House won't vote for that, even if a Senator is actually willing to sign the paper.
I have. Maybe you want to quote the part that you think is relevant? I didn't want to overload you with words because I was worried you'd miss the important parts.
From a practical perspective, what just changed?
Am I missing something, isn't the vaccine being sent to us from Europe? Once we get it sent to us, of course we should be using it and not sending it out to other countries.
RACIST!!!! America needs to be last! /s
Kinda pointless as Biden can just rescind the EO when he takes office.
CNN: "Trump Denies Vaccine to Billions Over Majority White Country"
The very fact that this is even needed illustrates how insane things have gotten.
I'm going to miss this guy (if things don't go our way.)
Biden's guy did not want America first distribution plan. So, it would look really bad for him if he ended up saying "I think we should officially give it to the rest of the world first."
No idea, wasn't this always the plan?  Why would we pay for vaccines from another country and then give them away without first keeping our people safe?  I'm kinda confused
Nothing. There were no plans for the government to give vaccines to foreign nations before meeting domestic demand, it doesn't and can't prevent private businesses from selling vaccines they've made to foreign entities, and even if the first two points weren't true, it could be overturned by Biden as it would be taking effect once he's in office.
More for us Canadians.  Thanks trump!
I don't think he will. Stuff like this just makes sense. All countries are prioritizing its own citizens over other countries. Biden isn't as liberal as you think. Biden would be a Conservative in Canada.If Biden does rescind this, rest assured he will face backlash from both sides.
That would look incredibly bad on Bidens part though. I think Trump is just signing these type of EO's as a middle finger to the Democrats and if they respond they fell right into his game.
Can you cite me a single article saying that the government (not private industry) was planning on shipping out vaccines before meeting domestic demand?No?Then how can you claim it was needed. This looks like 100% PR.
  **"Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. more vaccine doses."**Seems to me Trump has already fucked us vaccine wise....
And then the news comes out he turned away extra doses from Pfizer. Not such a great businessman
  **"Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. more vaccine doses."**Seems to me Trump has already fucked us vaccine wise....
  **"Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. more vaccine doses."**Seems to me Trump has already fucked us vaccine wise....
The Pfizer vaccine that is mentioned did not get funding from the US gov't. So I'm not sure how executive order would be able to override a company's autonomy and forcing them to give it to the US. Not sure how I feel about that.
I think this is to prevent Biden if he gets in the White House from giving to other nations first.
It's delusional to think that anyone of note in America wants the virus to last longer. I disagree with the left on a looooot of things, but they are still trying to do what they think is best. They want to get rid of the virus just as much if not more than the right. They're not cartoon villains.
Your tax dollars paid for it.
Trump said americans gets to utilize and benefit from the vaccine they developed first? Yes, I hope that is the case.
  **"Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. more vaccine doses."**Seems to me Trump has already fucked us vaccine wise....
I'd say if the medical data supports that course of action then why not?  The faster we get "herd immunity" for the planet, the faster we can go back to normal
Like I've been saying on all the other replies, whatever the medical data deems the best course of action to bring the planet back to a sense normalcy should be the course of action taken.  Science should drive policies, not the other way around.
It's literally in the article to prioritize the producing country, so if made locally in Canada or in US, prioritizing the countries own needs and citizens first, THEN helping the other countries by selling, or giving it as foreign aid :"The model allows the country that produces the vaccine to hold onto enough of a supply to reach a threshold for herd immunity ("Rt below 1"). Beyond that, the model supports distributing the vaccine internationally, which means giving away or selling doses of the vaccine before it's available to every citizen in that country, Emanuel explained to Scientific American."This one advisor is 1/10 on the board and even the model he suggests prioritizes citizens of the nation developing the vaccine first, then other countries.Did you just read the headline and linked the article?Edit: just also defining herd immunity, straight from Google: Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity.Now why is herd immunity the sort of gold standard, and practiced universally when dealing a large subset of the population or the population in its entirety? There are people in a population, always, that are more susceptible to diseases of any kind, even with a vaccine. Or those who are unable to take the vaccine, due to potential complications with other treatments they have. Or babies who cannot take the vaccine but are a vector of transmission or even susceptible to the disease itself. It's not that we don't want everyone to have the vaccine, it's that everyone can't take the vaccine such that when a threshold is reached for herd immunity, the population is considered not at risk of the disease spreading. So if there is a surplus after the population is considered resiliant to the disease, then selling it or providing it as foreign aid where applicable is what the model proposes. NOT giving it away to other countries before we ourselves have been taken care of.
  **"Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. more vaccine doses."**Seems to me Trump has already fucked us vaccine wise....
I think Trump is doing it for that very reason. That way the Biden administration has to explain why they are putting foreigners before Americans. The left will probably cheer the Biden admin for "humanitarian" reasons.
The mods are deleting comments because who the fuck knows why. The article specifically says that they'd only start shipping out vaccinations when herd immunity is reached which is the definition of meeting domestic demand.
I'd say if the medical supports doing such an action then it probably would be a good idea, if the whole world doesn't get "herd immunity" then the infection will just come back.
What medical data are you referring to?  Like I said, if the facts, not opinion or media, support it as a good course of action, then what's the problem?
Eradicating it from the world is the best defense. Otherwise it mutate abroad and run the risk of getting it back into the country.
What science is that?  As in, what are your sources?  Additionally, did we learn nothing from the Spanish Flu of 1917?  We ended it by quarantining.
So it isn't about facts?  If that's your viewpoint then you're entitled to it, but given that as a fact, I have no further interest in debating you.
He doesn't understand what herd immunity means.
tbf, her argument was pretty specious. I'm all for the supposition that where there is smoke, there's fire, but she's basically alleging a multi-state, multi-elected official arson conspiracy with very little to go on as far as hard evidence
Anybody know why it was dismissed? Wonderful reporting didn't seem to mention that. Unless of course, I miss it
Honest question here.  Is anyone else seriously concerned that regardless of the outcome, this election tampering and election fraud isn't going get resolved long term?  The behavior we have seen here isn't the actions of a small few.  This behavior is coordinated and widespread.  I find it frightening that so many people regardless of political leanings, would accept such an attack on one of the most fundamental parts of our system.  We have people in our country that genuinely hate the freedoms we have even though doing away with those freedoms would also adversely affect themselves.  This a level of insanity that is hard to grasp.  I don't think this kind of stupid can be fixed.
Based on laches again, what an injustice. The judge ignored the evidence and should resign from office.
Laches again, which is dumb and incorrectly applied.
You have to state a claim on which relief can be granted before the judge can look at evidence. The judge essentially said, "Even if everything you say is true, I can't do anything about it."
In the article they have the transcripts of what was said in the court room. You won't hear the audio, but you can at least read the back and forth communications. (it's on the last few pages of the PDF)
Was it latches? It sounds like a 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim to me. He says it's outside of the purview of a federal judge's authority to overturn a state's election results. So he means that even if there was fraud (which the judge clearly does not think exists), he would be constitutionally unable to do anything about it. It's up to the state.
yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but they are essentially just saying, "You didn't bring this soon enough and we don't have time or know how to provide relief if what you're alleging is true"  right?
You should be mad. If they ever find evidence, nobody will listen because these three morons have cried wolf everyday for a month.
Yeah, I think it's pretty clearly a sign of "Fuck, I don't wanna deal with this" than anything else
Wood is a life long Democrat who has never voted in a Republican primary and donated to the obamas.
I'm always worried about jinxing it too but so many of our side seems to be letting the feelings of defeat take over so I try to spread good vibes and keep our soldiers moral up.
That article confirms what I said. Did you even read it?
So... no voting record and conservative donor for 4 years telling republicans not to vote. Got it.
Racism is bad unless you are a democrat. Then it is just a way of life.
Days since a member of the squad said something anti-semitic: 2, I think
She should have never been able to get elected.....
I wonder if they've ever denounced anti-semitism or islamic terrorism.
Am I understanding this correctly? The tweet she made was, "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."And it was that tweet that lead to the call to remove her from office?This article was hard to follow because it kept throwing out inflammatory catchphrases. I couldn't clearly see what actually happened that lead to this call for her to be removed or resign.
It's not anti-semitic to criticize Israel.   Source: American Jew who criticizes Israel on the reg.
Many democrats are anti semitism Tlaib,Iihan,aoc,etc
She should be removed from America for being a toxic bitch
Yo, not supporting Isreal is not antisemitism
You've gotta be under 7 years old to think anti-israel is synonymous to anti-jewish. Israel is responsible for many war crimes and human right violations. Stop blowing hot air in each other's mouths.
Can anyone explain how being Anti-Israel means Anti-Semitic? One is a nation. The other is a faith.
Is being anti-Israel the same as being anti-Semitic? There is blood on both sides of that conflict. This seems more like political grandstanding to Evangelicals.
This is far beyond simple SJW campus racism.   > [The lawmakers gave remarks alongside speakers such as Tarek Hamoud, executive director of the Palestinian Return Center, which has reportedly been linked to Hamas.]    This is straight up U.S. elected officials spreading the cause of operational terrorists.
Also, it helps to target approved groups, which means white, Jewish, and/or Asian individuals, especially if they happen to be heterosexual males.
Like... to reporters? Or in general? Because in general... you need to be in the minutes column not days.
So in your mind is it possible to criticize of the state of Israel without being antisemitic?
The fact that her, Omar, and Cortex were elected (and re-elected) is but a symptom of the complete rot that American society is undergoing, with no signs of slowing down.
It's all part of the plan. The Muslims in Dearborn are doing exactly what they're meant to do. Just like the Somalis in Minnesota voting for Omar. You dont think they were settled there because it's so mich like their homeland do you? And of course there's the Hispanics that have flipped the Southwest/California and are working on Texas. Demographics are destiny and the left fully embraces it. Bring in countless millions of people to a country who have no connection to it, teach their children to hate it, and in a few generations you'll be able to destroy that country and/or implement your radical ideology.
Out and proud? In that case, can you provide me with a quote showing anti-semitic language?
Well, no.  Her support for terrorism was one of the reasons Democrats elected her in the first place.Now it just becoming known to the general public.
Do you have quotes for what they have said to disparage Jewish people?
Racism is ok against them Jews and conservative fake black people on the left. If you think BLM and antifa burning down your local police precinct is maybe not so good, racist!!!
You literally just did exactly what the article is condemning her for doing. Be better.
*paleA pail is a bucket.
Give me an example of Trump being blatantly racist or anti semitic or in any way verbally discriminatory towards any race. Also cite your sources.
Translation: TRUMP TWEETED SOMETHING THAT HURT MY FEELINGS SO THEREFORE ANTI SEMITISM DOESNT MATTER AT ALL!! AND IF YOU DISAGREE WITH MY FEELINGS YOUR A BIGOT!!
The same party whose politicians were sponsored by a group called Mitfah for their trip to "Palestine" - a nation that does not legally exist, because they don't want to be associated with the Jewish nation of Israel. Miftah's own website describes [suicide bombers] as simply 'resistance fighters'. They ran a report on their website in 2013 [accusing Jews of using the blood of Christians for passover], which is a common nazi/white nationalist accusation against Jews. Miftah [even openly promoted white nationalist material on its website], which Tlaib and Omar would not disavow. Tlaib and Omar even [openly displayed antisemitic, holocaust-denial artist's cartoons on their social media], the artist came in second place in Iran's International Holocaust Cartoon Contest.  The left panders to white nationalist organizations, holocaust deniers, terrorist supporters, want to constantly paint their enemies as 'deplorables' which is a dog whistle for 'undesirables' while using intimidation, silencing tactics, and outright violence against their opposition. We've seen all of this before from political parties that want to nationalize socialist policies.
There is a difference between opposing policies and calling for genocide.
Absolutely, as we should considering how much we fund that country, but theres a right way and a wrong way to criticize Israel
Would you say that comments that Omar has made are normal political criticisms of a country?
Wow, this is some of the most xenophobic shit I have ever seen on Reddit. These people are your countrymen, they have gained citizenship, just like your immigrant ancestors did too. If there are changing demographics in these areas, it is because America is changing, in both parties. But you are choosing to stay behind.
Say what you want, but that nasty bitch is a stain on this country.
Isn't Israel doing the same to Palestinians ?
I'm arguing labeling her that based on her being Somali is no different than her being anti Semitic.If she is corrupt and immoral because she's corrupt and immoral fine.
Everyone knows you have to drone strike children to get that
Also, what does being a businessman have to do with whether or not he's racist? So just because he is a billionaire businessman he's automatically racist? Your logic doesn't make sense to me, could you explain what you mean?
Yeah it's not calling for genocide just get rid of Israel
Using Hamas slogans calling for the destruction of the state of Israel is definitely the wrong way. Just like using Nazi slogans would be the wrong way to criticize the state of Poland.The right way would be saying Israel needs to change policy A for reasons B and C, and possibly replace it with policy D. Or action E was wrong and its perpetrators should face justice under the law.
I dont think you're asking me in good faith.    This is a good article.  Alleging American Jews have a secret allegiance to Israel like Ilhan Omar has is not the right way, it doesnt even make sense considering US Jews have a lower opinion of Israel than evangelicals have
Did he say I support the fact that this guy said white power, or did he simply retweet a statement from that guy that had absolutely nothing to do with when the guy said white power?
No different than saying people in Israel are money grubbing selfish people. See how wrong it sounds. If it's not acceptable about one group it's not acceptable about all groups.
At least you tried to back up the claim, but this in no way proves that Trump is racist, lmao.
Yup and he's taken back the tweet stating he didnt hear the guy, and he didn't retweet the video because of the guy shouting white power. This is not Trump being racist, lmao.
cause israel won the war, then they said they'd let palestein have some teritory and then palestine attacked them and lost it again. so, really sucks to be them (\^ \_ \^)
I'm a conservative and actively arguing against this guys actions. He's an ass and classifying a person purely based on religion, nationality, race or anything of that nature isn't acceptable. If you're a bad person, then you're a bad person. All else is irrelevant.
He claims he didn't hear the guy and has since refuted this. He has condemned white supremacy and white nationalism multiple times since this video was retweeted. Your people say that people grow and learn from their mistakes when people like Jimmy Kimmel get called out for doing blackface, so why does this logic not apply to a person who, immediately after retweeting, took it down and apologized and claimed that had he heard the guy say it he wouldn't have shared it. This is hardly proof of someone being racist and if this is the best you got then you should go ahead and call it quits.
Stop justifying classifying a group of people based on the actions of one. Or assuming based on their race/religion or country of origin anything about them.She's a corrupt anti Semitic piece of crap human because she is. Not due to anything else.Edit: stop being determined to die on this hill. What you said was wrong and is no different than her anti Semitic actions.
Lmao, all of that is absolute garbage. Way to provide nonsense dressed as racism and bigotry. You really are reaching to try and paint a guy who's done more for the black community in the past 4 years than Obama did in all his years in politics.
Islam never stops - it's only about controlling Jerusalem so the Muslims can convert all the temples and churches into mosques. No other reason they want the land the Jews have. And I think even regular Israeli's tend to be against the Zionist regeime from the ones I've met and encourage a more secular government which is good for everyone. Might get some harmony in the middle-east with more secularism
People here in Israel don't define Zionism as Religious. Most are secular or don't actively practice outside holydays/kosher food/etc. Zionism is defined as Jewish Nationalism (that's it).
Hahaha, at least they were ALL alive...
Man the bee is freaking amazing.
The Bee has surpassed every mainstream comedy product out there.
It was just a nice area of kids bro trust me bro
Santa is gunna run out of coal this year lmfao
Fact checker: The ballots showed up around 4:00 a.m. while the middle of the night was exactly at 2:11 a.m.FALSE - some liberal website... probably
Yeah r/politics just has articles with misleading headlines on their front page.
Double secret probation has now taken effect.
Good thing I pretty much stay in one room all day anyways.
Hell yes. Babylon Bee is taking over this sub and I am HERE for it.
As long as i can eat out at the French Landry with 10 friends, it should be ok.
Which is what most people in his Bay Area live in, for $2800 a month
... and I do not miss those outside tents
Wow, a glimmer of hope in a wasteland of liberal hell.
Kern County, Riverside, Orange County all now have had sheriffs stand up to this BS. I believe a Sacramento Sheriiff said the same. Meanwhile LA is getting rid of police and hiring social workers to be future stabbing victims.
Spend all of 2020 trying to defund the police and call them thugs and brutal racists. Expect police to spend 2021 locking people in their homes. Makes very little sense to me
Not sure why people think that they can trust the State with a man that slept with his best friend's wife.
Thank god that there are still some people in government that believe in the Constitution!
This is what I hope will happen if the progressives ever try a gun confiscation.
Punishing law abiding citizens is the core function of the California state government, they won't understand a word of this.
Newsome is a POS as is every Socialist Democrat.
In Orange County, the Sheriff basically said the same thing on their Facebook page. It's time for our law enforcement to stand behind it's citizens and not pander to political whims.
So nice that I can walk around naked and poop on the sidewalk here. Took my morning constitutional by their office
Imagine if Trump ever blackmailed, bullied, or used muscle against anyone. Remember when Trump had to disperse the protest in Washington DC so he could take a picture in front of that church? The dems went nuts claiming this same thing! Such hypocrites.
I love these based Sheriffs. But wonder, can Newsom punish them for disobeying him?
Bet they still won't clean up Skid Row. Even as a "social worker"
Future stabbing victims, harassment, and stalking
The LA County Sheriff also said he will not enforce this.
Probably the same way people voted for a guy that called his own daughter a "piece of ass"
The minute they start seriously considering that, the Democratic party loses half their base. They knew that, it'll never happen, nobody is trying to take your damn guns away.
Conditioning by the Government to make you more and more compliant and numb to your freedoms.
You know what's really shitty is that when everything does 'open back up' in places like CA, NY, and NJ, there literally won't be much of anything to have a grand re opening for.We are practically handing the middle class wealth to the Walton's, Newsom's, and etc. This is insanity.
If Trump did or said 10% of the things Newsom, Cuomo, or Wolf said this year, there would be people literally peeling their skin on the street for how fascist he is.
How do curfews even make any logical sense? Seems like they just squeeze business hours and would create more viral spread.
Carry on about your life and find out. Newsom can suck it.
What does my comment have anything to do with President Trump?  Are progressives NOT talking about gun confiscation?!?
Trump is all they can focus on. TDS is a very real thing
The operative word is "claims" - not "evidence". How many "claims" were there of Russian collusion? Did that make it real? Amistad Project is welcome to show all the evidence I'm sure they're keeping just behind that door over there.
The liberals will claim "it's not enough to swing the election". ;))
But his cabinet picks are amazing! It's Obama 2.0! /s
The fraud is evident no matter how you look at it. Letting this go unchecked and unchanged will forever change voting.
Not going to change the election
Russian collusion was investigated for three years.  The same people are trying to prevent even having a proper investigation.
This is the crux of the matter: don't claim that the election will be overturned when the court cases that haven't happened yet.
The key word here is "claimed" you can claim that every vote for a candidate is fraud but unless you can prove it, it's worthless. Hopefully with enough evidence we'll see something come of all the litigation.
* "NO EVIDENCE!"* "Sorry, sweatie, this was already debunked 2 weeks ago"
Close, the actual quote is: "We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics."
a "fraudian" slip, if you will
don't forget "i don't need you to get me elected, i need you once i'm elected"  i mean.. who says that to voters?  really?  The whole purpose of voting is because you need people to vote for you.. unless of course...  you already know the outcome.
Yep. I voted for the first time this year, and it will probably be my last time. I just don't trust the system anymore.
SCOTUS is likely to pass on granting Cert to hear it if it gets that far. It falls too closely under political questions doctrine
The report stated there was a lot of evidence, it also stated that subjects actively obstructed and misled the investigators, and it declined comment on criminal charges for a sitting president.No criminal charges doesn't mean no evidence.
Evidence please, why does Trump keep losing lawsuits if there was anything to go on? Judges he appointed keep shooting down efforts to invalidate millions of ballots, if there was evidence wouldn't he have won more than a single lawsuit to extend some deadlines in PA? Investigations take time, but we have deadlines to meet to certify the election before inauguration day. Would overturning GA somehow even flip the election Trump's way?If there really was a DNC/Biden effort to fraudulently flip AZ, NV, MI, PA, WI, and GA to Trump **and** there is evidence that is being ignored by Judges / the FBI, then yea the structures of the republic have been fully captured... but that sounds like a conspiracy theory.
Hopefully at the end of this the will of the people will have been done.Saying "hopefully the litigation will succeed" is entirely too self-interested. We only want litigation to succeed if its merits are sound.
Dude, the Trump campaign has only filed 4 or 5 lawsuits and they've already won 2. The rest of the suits are from other Republicans or civilian cases.
Just saying...everyone on this website will bitch and complain...but when Biden becomes president what will they do? Nothing. Biden won...thats the end.
And there were criminal charges brought against those people, and they were convictions, and sentences. (Excepting the notable cases, where people were pardoned)Edit: incorrect homophone (their, there, they're)
Why hasn't the campaign been able to prove in court that any of these ballot monitoring situations violated any state laws? When pressed to say whether there were campaign affiliates in the room, its 'there was a non-zero number'. When they are asked if there are situations where perfectly pristine computer-filled ballots could be legal, they acknowledge the law allows it. What they say in court contradicts what their affiliates are feeding the public without fear of real consequences.Have people considered that a lot of the things that don't look right to them are still consistent with the law of the people in these states?
Lol Trump tweeted about Romney votes getting switched to Obama via the machines in 2012.
I think he slipped. It could be argued the other way, but I'm inclined to believe he knew they were going to cheat based on his horrible election campaign and some of what he said. Things like, "I don't need your votes, I need your support after I win"
They could, but they also could decide that the question presented is fundamentally political, not suited for judicial review, and pass it to the other political processes we have to sort it out. It's not a satisfying answer, but it is an answer that the Court uses to avoid answering legal questions. It was a very big question and point of concern in Bush v. Gore (2000) and I could see it being a big hurdle here too. For an example, the Court decided that partisan gerrymandering was fundamentally political and nonjudicial in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) and that case dealt with an issue that is fundamentally related to how our democracy works at the state and national level. Again, not satisfying, but the Court has the authority to pass the buck.
And evidence that the campaign 'sought the same outcomes' as the IRA and russian government, and evidence that the campaign sought to coordinated obstruction of the investigation into russian interference, and evidence that several members of the campaign lied in effect to facilitate that influence.All I mean is, when the other user said 'there was no evidence' he fully misrepresents the contents of the report. If he meant 'insufficient evidence to make a positive conclusion about one specific criminal allegation' he could have made that more clear, I generally don't want to make assumptions about what other anonymous users meant when they left out information.
He will be sworn in. You can set a reminder for this if you want.
You might be thinking of two different stories. The video from state farm arena with no audio where a person tells a group of people congregated against a wall something, then goes on to pull ballots out of labeled black plastic tubs - that happens on a different night than the water main break. They both happened at state farm arena though.
Doesn't 'removal' require someone to actually remove them? Nobody called police, nobody was hauled out, we don't have audio to know what was said but nobody got combative, there was no argument about whether or not someone should remain, there was no 'removal'. So it seems like 'removal of' is at best a politically motivated lie about the video that we can all watch.'Witnesses not present' or 'witnesses decided to leave' might be accurate, although the last time a judge examined a campaign claim that 'witnesses were not present' resulted in an admission that 'a non-zero number of witnesses were actually present' but they had actively misled people about that fact.
It sounds to me like a Freudian slip, which is more common in those afflicted with senility.
Ah. You Got me this time. I mean Alito.
Yea, that video, that happens the day after the night of the water leak, those people don't get told to leave because of a water leak because the water leak from the previous night was already resolved by the time that happens.
The water leak was reported at about 5:30AM resolved at about 9AM, the video of people being told to leave happens at 10:30 PM.The water leak delayed a counting of absentee ballots from before in-person ballots were cast.So they happen less than 24 hours apart, but don't relate to the same groups of people.
Went and bought some to donate to the local food pantry after she said this shitWell AOC, seems like hispanics nationwide disagree with you
Hon, get a pot of chili on!
Had barely heard of it before all the nonsense. Now you can be damned sure that it's my go-to when it comes to beans and chili supplies
I just want us to seriously look at nuclear energy systems.
Contrary to the narrative, both EU and US carbon emissions have been decreasing for a number of years now.  And these gains have been totally offset and then some by china and india.
This is why we have to take manufacturing back and put them in places with better environmental laws. This doesn't surprise me at all. Not because I think Chinese people are more wasteful, but because they have SOOOO many factories and such shitty environmental laws.
And India is just now starting to really ramp up
But we need to hamstring our economy with a Green New Deal
Don't be ridiculous.  That would solve the perceived problem in a cheap and effective matter.  Politicians don't gain enough power from that.
God forbid... that creates too many American opportunities and ACTUALLY addresses the carbon emission problem concretely.  It's not possible to wail and lecture incessantly if you fix the problem efficiently.
There doesn't seem to be a good reason to do so. We're at the point where wind and solar are cheaper.I don't know anything about pv-magazine but there's a link to the actual report in the first paragraph or two.
I dont know why the left refuses to embrace nuclear energy. France gets the majority of its energy from nuclear if im remembering correctly
I watched Chernobyl on my jail breaked Fire Stick so I know a thing or two about nuclear pollution so there's no way I'm letting you build that in my backyard.
The Green New Deal is economic and national suicide.  Because China and India are the leading polluters, reducing emissions in the US won't have any material impact on the climate, but it absolutely will hamstring and stifle our economy.  The point, of course, isn't actually to help the climate, that's just a liberal lie - it's all about enabling *massive* grift by liberals.  Trillions of dollars of grift.
Number of years is understatement. It has been practically the same for last half a century.All the faster increase on co2 output in the last 20 years has been from India and China
WE have been China and India do not. Imagine that the world is bigger than your city. Crazy I Know.
Yeah they got about 70+% nuclear. They also got the only Nuclear Aircraft Carrier outside the USN.
The US would've been carbon neutral in our power grid by the early 1990s if the left hadn't decided to get scared of it and demonized a perfectly viable green energy source
The problem is that Democrats with the most power are shutting down our existing nuclear plants.  Obama shut down Yucca Mountain (nuclear waste storage facility) in his first term and it was nearly ready to go.
IIRC Ohio gets 30% of our power from the plants up on Lake Erie.
Hey, if it lowers land value in the area, I might actually be able to own a home! Win-win for me.
Dunno why you're getting down votes lol its obvious satire.
Or we will benifit from being the first to industrialize, investing in technology to reduce our dependency on finite resources, then sell the technology to other countries and profit. Instead we can destroy our precious land/water with fracking and deregulated fossil fuel industries and say "deal with it" to our children. Seems reasonable
Not throwing stones but you must consider emissions globally, or not at all.  US and EU are making progress and it is accelerating, this is very positive news.  China and india are have walked back every gram of these CO2 reductions and are in fact taking us backwards, this is not positive news.Spin it however you like, china and india are the crux of the global emissions problem at this point in time.  Any initiative that doesn't address their emissions increases is quite literally a waste of time.
Per capita is meaningless.  Their per capita numbers are only because of extreme poverty outside the main centers of wealth.China is laughing at western liberals worrying about this boogieman, while China keeps on doing what they want, getting free money from the UN, and selling all the idiots solar panels to boot.  I don't know what it will take for these idiots to wake up.
US emissions have gone down since 2000, China and India have increased carbon output by 400%.
Yeah, I didn't think I needed to use the sarcasm thing seeing what sub I'm in lol.
Yeah, and we don't have an enormous subsistence farming underclass.  We don't have the majority of our people live in absolute squalor. We also don't enslave ethnic minorities.
The leftist brigading is strong on this one.
Well that answers my question I suppose
Granted, I was only a toddler when it collapsed and we moved, but I was born on the other side of the iron curtain. Pretty much all of my family used to tell stories about blatantly corrupt shit that would go on every day, and you didn't dare question it. They'd just proclaim any dissent to be the result of a mental illness, or unpatriotic traitors.  They'd say they had already so thoroughly disproven any contrary claims that it didn't even bear disscussion how they'd done it.And you didn't DARE disscuss it, because that "mentally ill" bit was a veiled threat. The party, in thier infinite wisdom, had "discovered" a new mental illness known as "latent scitzophrenia." Its symptoms included skepticism of the ruling party, sympathy for western ideals, and an inability to correct dissenting opinions. It was a truly insideous disease, anyone could have it! It could lie hidden for years only to surface whenever it was convienient to drag a political rival or dissident off to a mental asylum.I grew up hearing these stories from relatives to illustrate why the USA was so much better to live in and how thankful we should be to live here. What the fuck is going on in this country?edit: I seem to have struck a nerve, my direct messege inbox is now overflowing with pissed off r/politics users telling me my family didn't really see what they saw. They fear the truth. Never forget that.
I read that they were scanning already counted votes and that the scanning process doesn't require supervision so that was done last.I'll be honest, I have no idea what I'm watching in the video. I have zero context, as do most of us. The only way I can know what it is I am seeing is if someone familiar with the process explains it to me. And, some election official commented on this video saying they were finishing up the scanning of votes.I feel like everyone has an agenda and a narrative and the waters on this are exceedingly muddy. Basically, I pretty much don't trust anyone at this point. I don't trust the people managing the process and I don't trust those signing affidavits. A situation has been created where I feel like everyone on both sides is lying.
Really hard to debunk footage of someone scanning the same ballots 2-3 times.All these "debunkers" have less credibility than Alex Jones at this point.
That tweet from ABC is very incriminating.
I had my share of the security video story get flagged on facebook, and they gave the Lead Stories article as the refutation. Straight up Ministry of Truth history revisionism. We are at war with Eastasia; we have always been at war with Eastasia.
Bring it out in court.  Color me skeptical, but I need to see this take a different path than other allegations.  Yeah, this video is the strongest evidence I've seen yet, but I need to see how it actually fares in the justice system.
"Hey MSM. I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word "Debunked" and expect anything to happen."&#x200B;Edit: I find the lack of office quotes disturbing
This whole things is so completely rotten. From the beginning we were told that counting had stopped that night. The media reported counting had stopped, broken water lines and delays and all sorts of stupid excuses. Then we get reports that poll observers were told to go home for the night because counting indeed would stop. Now there's actual video of counting in the middle of the night and all of a sudden the narrative is "counting did not stop, end of story". Fact checkers say counting did not stop, end of story. This election is a farce. It's bigger than Trump at this point. Have our presidential votes ever mattered in the last 30 years? What a complete joke.
Even ABC News reported on the election night that the ballot counting had stopped for the night.  *They reported this at 10:30 pm*, JUST as the Republicans had stated.  This is NOT debunked, and if this is ignored as well by the judges, we've got to do something.  We are losing our republic.  This can not stand.
The only thing getting debunked in this video is that the election was legitimate.
Can we just stop lying about all of this. First ballot counters were sent home because a pipe burst. Then this video footage comes out clearly showing no pipe had burst.Then we have government officials being quoted saying what we saw on the video footage is perfectly normal. Now we have a website claiming nobody was told counting was stopped and to go home despite countless eyewitness and media reports that's exactly what happened.The cat is out of the bag, can we all just put our cards on the table. The same way everyone was calling for "evidence" from the Trump legal team. Now that the evidence is out, it's time to explain it.
Wow this whole article is extremely substantial.. the fact checkers taking the corrupt government officials at their word is just ridiculous.
Remember when Dominion was accused of their voting machines switching votes, and it got "debunked" simply because they denied it?  Pepperidge Farm sure as fuck remembers.  You post the article, and they would post the source "debunking" it with Dominion denying the allegations.Fucking Lefties will believe anything with a catchy headline.
I love how even on this subreddit, it's the same group of bridagers that come in these threads and state that there's no evidence, even given everything that has been revealed up through this point. I'm thoroughly convinced now that reddit is filled with Chinese bots. No other explanation at this point.
Uhm sweetie, twitter said it's D E B O N K E D, and why would they lie? TRUST THE SCIENTISTS YOU RETHUGLICAN
If this happened in one state, I cannot see why it wouldn't have happened in other states.
I would be interested in hearing directly from the people in that video. Were they ever present in the hearing?
Quick summary: \- ABC 's tweet at the time and sworn republican observers affidavit both say officals said the counting was done for the night at 10:30pm. This is the time everyone on the camera leaves.\- The fact-checkers/officials pretend they never told the republican observers to leave and they just chose to do so. (which makes no sense)
We're at step one on that road right now. Currently you just get censored if you say something they don't like. Just wait for "hate speech" laws to start. Then they'll start including more and more into those laws. If you criticize the ruling party, you're contributing to "hate"..
Are r/politics users responding to you because of this comment or was it another one that you posted on a different sub? If it's a different comment, can you give me a link to it?I just want to know which comment I should award gold to.EDIT: I just decided to award this comment. Yes, I know it supports Reddit but to be fair, I did already have the coins prior to this, so it's not like a paid Reddit money just to be able to gild this comment.
there is nothing more equitable than free speech for all, regardless of their opinion or beliefs.
> edit: I seem to have struck a nerve, my direct messege inbox is now overflowing with pissed of r/politics users telling me my family didn't really see what they saw. They fear the truth. Never forget that.This is the part that infuriates me the most.  How dare these sheltered brats have the audacity to dispute your family's experience?  They know exactly what they are doing: trying to intimidate you in silence.  I will be happy when all of these traitors hang...in Minecraft.
We're very very gradually turning into what you described above, and unless people rise up and fight this, we are doomed to repeat the fate of the Soviet Union.  It's going to take a VERY long time for it to happen, but it will happen.  The warning signs are all around us, and communism is winning here.Some 23% of young people in America have a favorable view of socialism now.  This *drastically* up from only 20 years ago.  This is scary.
>What the fuck is going on in this country?Corruption fueled by money. To the left, what you experienced didn't really happen and you're a lying loon bag. We "haven't tried socialism/communism correctly" and we never will. Where they want to take us is a very very dark place....
Millions of Russians voted for Trump this election because they see what's going on. That's the "Russian Collusion" which Democrats will not forget.  Russian people better understand what's at stake.
Russian KGB Programs in the 1960s and 70s were focused on destroying the moral fabric of this country and infiltrating our education system. They invested hundreds of billions of dollars into the effort and it was so successful that even after the collapse of the SU our educators are still brainwashing kids into becoming Communists. Unfortunately, parents have been so disengaged from their children they don't even realize it, higher education is the worst culprit.
Honestly, I no longer believe that there is a peaceful resolution to our country's cultural divide. The left lives in a bubble that, unfortunately, causes them to react violently when confronted with reality. That they would deny the personal experience of your relatives is evidence of this. They have to be contained, because with this mindset they would gleefully oppress us all and would do so with the consent of their own conscience.
This.  Need it to have its day in a court of law, not just a press conference, like at least half the allegations.
Sure but then why send everyone home? Surely observers are allowed to be there to ensure no funny business.
Even the fact checkers say they were counting, not scanning, and the official pole watcher themselves admitted to not being there for an hour of the time they were doing so
but the fact that those ballots were kept under a table with long tablecloths that the blond braid lady had set up that morning prior to others coming in is suspicious at the very least...
At this point, I trust Alex Jones way more than MSM. He probably has a better record of being right.
People are easy to dismiss Alex Jones as nuts. He might be, and he does say some very bizarre thing sometimes. But I think people would actually be surprised at how much he ends up being right on stuff
He was right about basically the entire elite class being pedophiles. Plenty of people called him crazy for that one.
"Your honor the plaintiff claims that there was four suitcases hidden under a table that contained ballots that were secretly counted without any observers present after everyone was asked to leave because of a fake water leak. HOWEVER if you digitally enhance the image you can CLEARLY see that they were boxes and not suitcases. Your honor, we officially ask that you declare this case DEBOOOONKED!!!"
I read 1984 in high school in the early 2000s. Never did I think we'd be living it.
Just wait until it becomes the ministry of love that gets you not the ministry of truth.
1984 wasn't supposed to be a guide book :( and here we are.
They have no choice but to say "debunked" because their viewers need to hear it to keep their head in the sand.
Tulsi stepped down from the dnc in 2016 saying they were supposedly rigging the primaries for Clinton. Not that I would ever want Bernie, but I just thought it was weird how she said that.
Guaranteed there was fraud last election but they just didn't expect so many people to come out to vote for trump. This time they knew they'd have to go all out and get far more risky.
All of us watching the election live saw it when it happened and thought it was suspicious. They are attempting to gas light people with blatant lies and call it fact checking.These outlets should rename themselves to "Fact Correctors". They are propaganda.
Fact checkers claims that state official clears self for wrongdoing. Fact Checkers have determined that this claim is false. No fraud.
Haha, or this video above the fact checkers saying they are not suitcases but ballot holders therefore the whole thing is debunked lol
I had a guy link me to the Dominion website where they denied it as proof of it being debunked.
Nah, there's no Chinese bots on reddit. They have enough citizens to actually use real people to reply to the comments. Probably running multiple accounts at one time as well.
I don't think you guys on the left will ever just take the "L" though
' If you criticize the ruling party, you're contributing to "hate" 'I wouldn't be very surprised AT ALL if this were suggested by the left.  This is exactly how they operate, and we've seen it a million times before.
We are on step 5/6. This has been in play for decades. Small changes over long periods of time. Conditioning of society. Moral decay. Indoctrination in our education system. Federal reserve. Uncoupling of our currency from gold. The New Deal. Welfare state. NSA. Nanny State. Uncontrolled debt. Unbalanced budget. Bias news. Control the narrative. COVID is the nail. The coffin has already been built.
There are plenty of 1A and 2A shall we say "enthusiasts" who will have a big problem with this, myself included. We have something this socialist shitholes don't have on our side, The Constution of the United States of America, brought to us by thug life founders. No matter what they try, we have a legal foundation to fight back.        [Gun Totin Patriot]
Probably this one.  I get messages from politics users all the time, most are collapsed because they are not kind.Others are looking to have a 'conversation'.  I kindly tell them no thanks, we aren't going to change each others mind no matter what, and wish them a good day.  This usually upsets them and they spew unimaginable amounts of hate.I think most of them are banned from replying in this sub so they message directly.
Don't gild. Don't give reddit a cent.
I was born and raised in Poland, under soviet control. I know exactly what OP is talking about. You can award me if you like. Kurwa.
Agreed but it's not going to take long. The young people you mention are already at the age to start having families and are suppressing any thought/speech that doesn't align with their views at alarming rates... This summer it was pancake syrup that hurtful. They are pushing hard enough that there were "hidden Trump supporters" in the polls this year just out of fear of retribution.
Yeah, my wife grew up in East germany, and both of us have worked our whole lives to earn our US citizenship. We know how bad it can get. Its time to drop this nice guy "well we gotta wait for them to make a move first!" bullshit. They already did, they have been making moves for decades. Every time conservatives ruffle thier feathers and go "NEXT TIME YOU BETTER WATCH OUT! ONE OR TWO MORE AND YOULL SEE HOW WE REACT AFTER THREE OR FOUR MORE STEPS YOU'LL SEE!" Its time to quit talkin shit and put this totalitarian bullshit down like ol yeller.
I cannot tell you how many people I've seen who were legitimately spouting crap like "the gulags weren't bad"... I just don't understand how people can know anything about the USSR, live in comfort in the USA, and still be pro-Soviet apologists.
They'd tell themselves they were oppressing us to protect themselves from oppression. Its an easy fiction to maintain when one decides to redefine oppression as "being disagreed with."
I didn't see one person protest as they were leaving. If your job was to be there and watch the verification and counting process...would you just gladly pack and up and leave without any resistance whatsoever if there were folks still there? I wouldn't. I would be on camera making a bit of a stink of my job were to watch the process and they told me to leave while workers were still present.
Well, from the fact checking website that is linked in the article...they they were scanning after hours...---Election workers known as "cutters" because their job was to open absentee ballot envelopes and verify ballots for eventual scanning and counting were dismissed for the night sometime after 10 p.m. on November 3, 2020, because their work for the evening had been completed, he explained. Those workers who remained were responsible for conducting the scanning portion of the process, since ballots could not be left without being scanned overnight. He said: "If you look at the video tape, the work you see is the work you would expect, which is you take the sealed suitcase looking things in, you place the ballots on the scanner in manageable batches and you scan them."
He did get the frog thing right
The great reset talk coming from dozens of countries makes Alex Jones New World Order "conspiracy theory" seem pretty rational at this point. As does a statistically impossible national election.
Fun fact: Alex Jones predicted on July 25th, 2001 that 9/11 would happen. Check out this clip: "If you let some terrorist group blow up the World Trade Center, we know who to blame."Chilling shit.
I can tell you I was, I always had this notion that Alex Jones was like the National Inquirer of podcasts. Them turning the friggin' frogs gay actually being true is what turned my opinion of him around. Now, more and more I'm starting to believe Alex Jones may be a true American hero.
His podcast with Joe Rogen is excellent
I literally could not believe an article I shared got fact checked to say "*Claim: Ballots were in suitcases.* ***FALSE:*** *They were in ballot boxes.*"Like, ok? They were still brought in and scanned when no one was looking????
It is in the article. I remember seeing the same reporting from the NYT on election night, on their "live update" thing on the site. Pipe burst, everyone went home.
in the federalist article attached, there is a tweet from ABC saying the counting stopped for the night at 10:30pm, which is also what the republican observers say they were told.On the contrary, the officials(and "fact checkers") pretend that they never said the counting ended and that the republican observers just chose to leave.
Even if a person didn't believe any fraudulent votes were cast in the primaries, it's pretty tough to believe that media coverage of the candidates was in any way fair or impartial. Winners and talking points were picked before the debates even took place. Tulsi wrecked Kamala in the debates this year and absolutely nothing came of it because she got no coverage.
I'm sure you're right. I'm sure there's fraud all of the time.But what is really baffling to me is how anyone can look at the last 4 years and NOT think that rotten political operatives would dare to commit voting fraud. We've seen fabrications involving racism, sexism, and homophobia. (Inner city Chicago, this is MAGA country anyone?) We've seen supreme court justices being outright dragged through fictitious mud. We've seen stories of Russian sabotage being used as a boogeyman for 4 straight years. We've seen "kids in cages" and we've seen "fine people on both sides", both of which are completely horseshit stories that either omit the most relevant details or flat out are used out of context. But now we're supposed to believe everything is done with the utmost integrity? Give me a break.
Democrats have thoroughly investigated themselves and found no wrong doing. DEBuNkeD!
Was it Politico that said they weren't biased, because they fact checked their own bias?  Sad thing is, r /politics tards will actually link that shit as a source *unironically*.
:'D "Your Honor,  I am not guilty, despite the blood you see on my hands in this picture of me kneeling over that dead woman's body. As proof, I offer you my word!"
We've actually had a form of this since 2008. Try criticizing Obama's policies or presidency in a room full of Democrats, or right here on Reddit proper for that matter, and you'll be branded a racist, nazi, white supremacist who just doesn't like the idea of a black man in charge. Obama basically said it himself just recently. Which is hilarious, because it doesn't explain why I wanted Herman Cain to win the 2012 Republican primary and the general election that year, and have always supported Clarence Thomas, arguably one of the most powerful people in the nation. It's almost like I don't give a shit about color and care more about their political stance.They are doing it again now with Kamala, except it has the extra added effect of you being a misogynist in addition to a bigot for not liking her or her views.
>' If you criticize the ruling party, you're contributing to "hate" '  >  >I wouldn't be very surprised AT ALL if this were suggested by the left.They already started with Obama. They condemned all criticism of Obama as "racism"....thus "hate."
This is my concern. You see it a lot here. 'Oh, we can't actually fight against the encroaching tyranny because we have jobs to go to in the morning'.That's exactly how we slip into communism, or some twisted cousin of it. Because conservatives decide to stick their head in the sand and hope that it won't affect their own private little kingdoms. It will, sooner or later. But they just refuse to see it because they have worked so hard to get so much. And they don't want to admit that it's all going to be taken from them by these people. Either it'll be sooner, when you have some chance to win it back, or later, when their power will be so absolute that they will just grind you into sludge.
That's what happens when you hype up exaggerated propaganda about American war crimes in Vietnam and police response to rioting during the civil rights era.Paint America as an irredeemable bad guy, and then that other nation that has done *absolutely nothing at all* except help us in WWII doesn't seem so bad.
Socialism is a fantasy of a world where all your problems disappear. There are people who *choose* to need that fantasy. They will eagerly buy any blatant lie, tell themselves any nonsensical story, in order to preserve that fantasy for themselves.
They are health camps aren't they - lose weight, work hard, excercize.Those who ignor (or delete) history, are bound to repeat it.
If the election officials said that the voting was concluded for the night, I probably would leave. Which is what they did.
I always thought it was funny that out of all the crazy things he's done and said, the "gay frogs" thing is what everyone uses as a sound-bite to mock Alex Jones as a loony, when that whole thing is actually a thing that exists and is a problem.
Okay, but lets be real: if you have a guy who says enough 'plausible' but insane-sounding crap, then go back over his dozens or hundreds of statements ("predictions") you can find some that seem to be right on the money. He's not particularly accurate if only 1 out of every 10 or less 'come true.'Especially since there had [already been an attempt] to blow up the buildings.I will say, Alex Jones was and is 100% right that there is an active information war waging where propaganda, misinformation, and coverups are used to influence how you think and act. The fact that he was banned from the internet is a coordinated strike actually **proved** this fact. How can you NOT root for him after that?He's just not a great influence when it comes to deciding what to do with the fact that your mind is being targeted by hostile actors.
I mean not really. The World Trade Center was attacked in 1993... with a bomb. A callback to an event that already happened, used as a hypothetical in a throwaway remark, is hardly a prediction that 9/11 would happen (to say the least).
Go watch the pilot episode of the X-Files spin off "The lone gunmen"You will shit a brick...
Yeah it was a joke because that detail changes literally nothing about the story.
"In addition to my word, I have provided a link to an article where the author says they spoke with a source who said there was no evidence of me committing the murder, despite all the evidence. So, this has clearly been debunked your honor"
" Try criticizing Obama's policies or presidency in a room full of Democrats, or right here on Reddit proper for that matter, and you'll be branded a racist, nazi, white supremacist who just doesn't like the idea of a black man in charge. "AOC pulls that shit virtually any time she's criticized.
Whenever you meet a commie it was always not real communism or socialism, and if it was, it only failed because they weren't the one in charge.
Yeah, interesting how shortly after they get power people tend to start disappearing too.
It's the delivery. It sounds deranged and hilarious.
I thought I was the only one! I knew about the frog thing from reading science magazines when I was younger. It was already a known thing among biologists and then people were laughing at him and I was confused.
just loosely that there some cabal of elite world leaders all working together to craft a grand, global, socialist utopia
I had one try me a few months back. Even cited some 3 examples of times that "true communism" worked. I looked em up, gave the individual the benefit of the doubt as their argument wasn't full of cursing and belittlement. I truly believe that they were being sincere. A quick read showed that these societies, sounded nice, but quickly devolved and failed, none lasted more than a few years at most.
Reality is often deranged and hilarious.
Well said. Basically very powerful people already have decided to become the kings of the world. America's Constution is the wall, we are the only country on Earth with a first and second amendment. Free speech is dying all over the first world.       I know it sounds crazy, but it's happening, now.
These systems are ideologies that should never be considered outside of academia. They look great on paper when you think you are the intelligencia and are above all the simpletons.
"Work in the salt mines? Don't you know I have a masters in gender studies and a minor in transexual underwater basket weaving theory? Oh ho ho no my friend. I'll be a high level intellectual on a central planning committee who gets paid for my great ideas!"
Regina Waller seems to be the one who would have all the answers  According to the people who were told they were done counting for the night, she was the one who told them they were done and would not resume counting until the morning.  She's also the one that placed the table there in the morning, and the one seen to be pulling the ballots out once everyone had left, and seen to be suspiciously palming what appeared to be a USB from her mother.    A mother who had fraud charges in the past, and recently canceled an interview because she decided to seek legal counsel.
He is my absolute favorite Old Hollywood actor. He was the first major actor to enlist during WWII at 33 and got his commanding officer to actually send him into the fight. Most actors were used more for recruiting efforts or kept out of the action because of their celebrity status. He was a bad ass pilot and stayed in the Air Force until his mandatory retirement at 60. He even flew a mission in Vietnam. He retired a brigadier general.
We need more cultural icons who are not actors
Jimmy was one of the good guys. He somehow remained unchanged by Hollywood and stayed a decent man until the day he died. Mr Stewart sure is missed.
Do you ever think that our entire nation is now transforming from Bedford Falls into Pottersville?  Seems pretty obvious to me.
He is my all time favorite actor. After he was given a star to become a Brigadier General in the Air Force he attended a function with Ronald Reagan. Reagan kept mistakingly called him Major General.  In an interview after the event a member of the Press asked him why he did not correct the President.  Jimmy responsed with, "Oh I dunno, It's just Major General sounds so good." Lol.  Class man. Very decent and honorable. And smart. He graduated from Princeton.
Jimmy Stewart would get no clicks today. His whole ethos was stalwart constancy. That's only enough content for one five-minute YouTube video, for today's audiences.
Fast forward to today, where it is all about "me, me, me" and people want to be remembered for superficial reasons.
Iirc, he's the actor with the highest military rank if you don't count Ronald reagan being CINC
I agree with you.However in the case of Jimmy Stewart, he was actually much more than just an actor.
So it's bad when an amoral greedy old man who names places after himself is in charge?
Pete Davidson is playing the role in an online script reading that's acting as a fundraiser for the Ed Asner Family Center, an organization that offers tons of services to developmentally challenged children and their families. I wouldn't exactly call that a negative.
Just to clarify, it's only a table read not a remake. Not saying I agree with the choice still, but as far as I know there is no remake being made.
He said he is god fearing, how does that translate to America being a Christian nation?
That's why they elected the antithesis of all that in Donald Trump... No, wait...
A lot of famous folks served in WWII and they all deserve our respect.  Ted Williams, Henry Fonda, Mel Brooks.  Even Bill Blass the designer played a role in helping to fool the German's prior to D day.  [It's a facinating story].As for Jimmy Stewart,,, just the best kind of person,  the kind of person I was taught to respect and emulate when I was a child, I'm old.
79th Anniversary of Mostly Peaceful Flyover by the Japanese Navy Air Corps - NYT Headline, probably
How does it feel to preemptively play the victim?  Ironically, the only person politicizing a horrible event in our country's past is you and a few other conservatives on this post.
Well, Pearl Harbor is a big reason why America joined the war, so, no, probably not.
~700,000 people died during the spanish flu, what do you think?
It's a very fitting quote. But that there is no definite proof that he ever said this is a fact, not rewriting history.(also it seems everyone can call himself a historian nowadays. I have a Bachelor's degree in history. Am I a historian? I seriously doubt it)
COVID has a 99% survival rate and for some reason it stays away from BLM protests and Biden victory rallies but magically shows up at Trump rallies. When BLM was everywhere, the virus magically went away from the press headlines. 2 people infected in one state? UH-OH shut it down! But wait if I'm a governor I guess I can dine in restaurants! But BLM! Meanwhile in WW2 Americans fought and died pouring men into the biggest conflict ever known to man. You didn't even know if you were going to make it. Many didn't. As soon as those doors on the ships opened in Normandy, many got popped at the beginning, never to see anyone again. Not only there but many died around the world. The Soviets suffered huge and in turn they also did against the German peoples. Britain was alone in the war. How is COVID more deadly than WW2? It isn't the black plague.
Oh, so no ones forcing you to catch covid, so we cant blame the people who catch it? That makes it thr exact opposite of the 2 afformentiomed attacks on america. They were acts of war against the servicemen AND citizens of the US. Covid is a virus that is just trying to live. That life may be impeding us and making our lives more difficult, but its certainly not killing 1,077 peacetime sailors in under 10 seconds. So no, covid will not be remembered as an attack on American sovereignty and way of life. It will be remembered as a time of scam of the government against the people, and will be as faint a memory as the 1918 spanish flu.Oh, and one more thing: I dare you to go up to a 9/11 survivor and tell them covid is more important than what happened to them, or even a Pearl Harbor veteran. At over 90 years old you would still get your dim lights punched out.Remember the day of infamy. Remember the fallen.
He's a legendary debater. I would love to see him present the argument!
Ted Cruz is gonna be the next GOP nominee next time. Trump will be too old. Ted cruz is the only one with any balls.
Friendly reminder that in 2016 Donald Trump publicly called Ted Cruz's wife ugly. Here we are, 4+ years later, and Cruz is still firmly in his pocket. Trump owns him.
This needs to happen quick before Giuliani recovers.
Teddy will get it done... Cruz 2024
I'd even say he's a.. Master.
If Ted Cruz's dad can kill Kennedy, then surely Ted Cruz can win a simple court case.
Trump isnt generally one for sharing the spotlight, even when it would be to his advantage to do so.
You must have taken a detour and got lost. You belong here: r/politics
Ted Cruz is an American Citizen. His mother was a US citizen at the time of his birth, which makes him a Natural Born Citizen, and eligible for the Office of the President.
He was born on an Army base i believe. He's eligible to run. He wouldnt have been in the primaries otherwise dont listen to the troll.
*No* state level, or local, election should have money from outside the state in it. Period.
This ship has sailed. This is protected as free speech.
I'm glad to know there's still one thing that conservatives and liberals and socialists and libertarians all agree on.**Everyone** hates Mark Zuckerberg.
You'd better be equally good with preventing the Koch brother (pretty sure one died) from doing the same thing or you're a hypocrite asshole.  Better yet, overturn citizens united and generally limit money in politics.   Ooh, or here's a good one, just cap what they can spend so candidates have an equal budget.   Let's see who can be effective while dealing with spending constraints.   Seems like a good test for a would be public official.
This is one step away from calling for the end of citizens united. Spending is speech and it should be free. If you change the name to Charles Koch and post this in r/politics the comments will be pretty similar.
Someone had to pay for all those ghost ballots.
Unfortunately campaign finance reform is an unpopular opinion among Conservative officials. I think McCain was the last major Republican to support it.* The Conservative justices decided both *Citizens United* and *McCutcheon*.* [The DISCLOSE Act of 2010 was shot down along party lines.]* [Trump stopped requiring certain non-profits from even disclosing when they spend money on politics.]Campaign finance reform is only supported by Democratic officials currently. McConnell will not bring any federal bill about it to a vote.
Make lobbying illegal and you'll solve that problem.
> the end of citizens unitedThis is a very popular opinion for voters of both parties. Most people do not think spending should be considered speech. It's mainly just spenders and the political elite benefiting from that spending that endorse it.
Too bad that Congress is the one that would have to pass such a law and nearly half of Congressmen take a lobbying job when they leave office now. Supporting politicians is one thing both parties can agree on.
Thank you! You said well what *Citizens United* does so I'll quick list some things it **didn't** do:+ Say corporations are people (corporate personhood far outdates this case and is based in old common law, how else would you sue a company?)+ Say money equals speech (they were ruling on the publication of a movie, that's clearly speech)+ Say Congress can't regulate "dark money" (the FEC still has lots of reporting rules and spending limits on campaigns and SuperPACs)+ Create SuperPACs (different, but related case)
Wallace's stock has gone down **severely** since he beclowned himself during the first debate. He's now spurned by both his peers in other media groups and his own viewers. I dare say his numbers won't recover anytime soon, if at all.
Leftist assholes are the self-appointed language police.
He should have told Wallace that claim is currently disputed according to his fact checkers.
fuck this guy who said shit about lie after lie regarding russia hoax and impeachment lies
Well of course he did. He clearly views himself as some of sort of neutral "news referee" who gets to decide such matters. His daddy would be rolling over in his grave if he saw this behavior.
Chris Wallace is an insufferable asshole.
This is the weirdest media fixation. Regardless of how clear Biden's victory seems, the electors haven't voted yet. I don't think it's wrong to call him "president-elect," but it's certainly acceptable not to.
I am not a fan, and would have said "nah".
How long before Wallace is sucking bidens dick? I bet less than a month or hes already latched on to it
Right before Bill Clinton took the oath of office at his first inauguration the Chief Justice said, "Governor, are you ready to take the oath?" The proper protocol is to address someone by the highest office he has held.
As a point of fact, and all of us here know it, Biden is not president-elect yet.CW needs a fact checker.
> He's now spurned by both his peers in other media groups and his own viewers.He's just another moron who learned nothing from megan kelly.  You can kiss the leftist ass all you want but they have already identified you as a previous truth teller which can never be tolerated.  So now he can spew the leftist lies and non leftists turn him off along with the left.
Chris Wallace is a leftist now? Is that word just used against anyone y'all disagree with regardless of ideology?
The fact that he IS NOT PRESIDENT ELECT YET and they dont care to be accurate with even that fact but keeps pishing it, shows how much of a steaming pile of shit these "journalists" are
It isn't an official title, so there is n official time. Traditionally, it's after the results of the election are clear, which they have been for a few weeks now. Traditionally, we don't have a president ignoring the fact that he lost an election, nor a circus of sycophants doing the same.
The electoral college meets on Dec 14th. After that the victor of the election is president elect.In the past, after the losing party concedes, the victor of the election has been called the president elect despite it not being official until Dec 14.
Why..?Most of the rest of Fox is just as bad as he is, now...
Yes, just like every Democrat is now a socialists and anyone who supports Palestinians is an antisemite. Anyone who disagrees with the right is clearly a leftist. Mueller was a Democrat, in 6 months when Republicans start to try and distance themselves from Trump they will all be RINOs.
Not so much that as that leftist morons can all fuck the hell right off.
> The fact that he IS NOT PRESIDENT ELECT YETUmmm, yes he is. He's got the same standing for that title as every other president elect before him. Though it isn't an official title, it's still bestowed on the candidate who is projected to win the election, once that prediction is sound. For President Elect Biden, that was weeks ago.
You are lying. Every election they refer to the winner as President elect prior to the electoral college vote.   Were you this worked up when CNN called Trump President Elect on November 6th, 2016?
I didn't think a #notmypresident redux was our style...
Maybe to braindead idiots like you and the Libs.
No he isn't, the election isn't final yet. In another week that may be true but for now he is not
Also, imagine the backlash if Biden (or any other incoming U.S. President) literally sat on his ass until he was officially sworn in under some idiotic semantic argument.
"President Elect" isn't an actual title. It's  just a term used by media. It means nothing.
Ok, let's use his actual title: Impeached President Trump.
Y'all both gotta chill. But I do agree withe the other guy. Especially in the New York Times, they call President Obama "Mr. Obama" all the time. It's not a big deal.
My point was who gets to decide what's legit and what isn't? Technically the election is disputed, or does the tag only apply to what suits an agenda?That's why I think it's best to just not bother with a tag. You set a precedent that needs to apply across the board, not just to what you disagree with.
>I didn't think a #notmypresident redux was our style...The right, including Trump,  pushed the narrative that Obama was not even an american citizen. And you guys think that kind of shit isn't your style? Do you live under a rock?
This is the first time that there has been a dispute about calling someone president elect. The closest we can get is to 2000, where we had to wait for about a month before anyone got to call themselves that. The fact that the Clinton administration still started a handover with Bush before the election had been called, just goes to show how stupid and petty Trump, MAGA nation and the GOP are being.
And Trump when he won, right?
I mean, I'll cop to being way more moderate/left than most of the regulars here, but one of the key reasons that I still view myself as center-right is that I hate how melodramatic and petulant the left is and that I've always seen the right as broadly more mature. I thought Biden beating out the left's darlings in the primaries might be a sign that the Democrats were finally growing up a little but it's all a bit pointless if folks on the right just take their place...
Mate if getting a lawyer is evidence of guilt.... I got news for you.
...that's the point.  They are driving their core demographic away and will not be watched by anyone else.  Leaving them without viewers.  Was that not clear?
The handover started at least a couple weeks after it should. The Pentagon has also been a road block in a proper handover. Trump has also yet to actually acknowledge reality, and since the guy at the top sets the tone, it won't be proceeding like it should.> don't you want fair elections?Yes, and seeing the disaster you lot have every four years, I am so happy to be a Canadian. Everything about your elections is a mess, but the allegations Trump are making, have no basis in reality. There is very little fraud, and a lot of the actual fraud that's been brought to light, was committed by Republicans.
Not the left - I don't expect them to ever really change. I thought the Democrats as a party though were learning to ignore the left and be more realistic. Of all their major candidate options they picked (arguably) the most moderate. I'm still holding out hope that Biden and McConnell can hash out some basic bipartisan deals.
I mean, there are issues though where government action is necessary:- High cost of healthcare- Ballooning cost of higher education- Big Tech (anti-trust and privacy concerns)- National Debt- Immigration- Unfunded pension liabilities Those are just off the top of my head too. I want my government dealing with these issues and I want both parties involved.
Please find someone to give you a hug.
Careful supporting this guy, he's more of a stepper than you'd think.
Alt Right, Alt Right, Alt Right
The fact he would even say something like this is enough to win over some dems that are tired of being blackmailed into staying in the party.
If I remember correctly he identifies as a centrist. Read an interview he gave a few years back where he views both sides of american politics as being inherently flawed do to the left and the right refusing to work together to fix society's problems. And due to the media on both sides blaming the other side for all of the problems instead of coming up with pragmatic rather than ideological solutions.
He's a solid actor, but not the sharpest person out there.
As proof of this, look at how CA voted on affirmative action. Landslide against AA while landslide voted for Biden. It goes to show that Democrat politicians are popular because the media makes it seem Republicans are the devil, but the actual policies Democrats want to propose are very unpopular. If academia, Hollywood and the media stopped brainwashing the masses, Democrats would never win.
To be fair, Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor.
If I remember correctly, the Greeks would not allow actors to give testimony because they were considered professional liars because of their profession. Obviously I don't think we need to go that far, but it makes sense
It's almost like you shouldn't trust someone who lies for a living...
Yeah, tbf, he's one of my favorites.  Just listened to Greenlights a few weeks ago as well.  I'd hang out with him, hunt with him, do some drugs with him, etc. I would not support him in a political arena.
Which is sad because as United America we can still be the superpower that we traditionally have been. As divided america we are nosediving towards late 80's soviet union status. United we stand divided we fall
I just watched the episode.. I thought the writers did a great job describing both sides of the issue.. It's about time someone sticks up for the 99.99%of police that are incredible heroes. All we get, if you follow the mainstream media, is that cops are bad.. That's what comes across even if it's not their intent.  But wait until there's a major problem and the police are the first to arrive to help people. The hypocrites, left media, will be all over that and for a few days, police will be heores again.. Rarely does the media provide both sides of the story.. Usually only the victims, and I'm most cases they're not completely innocent.. Kudos to the writers of blue bloods for being honest and portraying the issues.
I was wondering if they would pander to the bullshit from the left in Hollywood.Good for them for not doing so.It's sad that all the other shows will be in syndication someday and the left will probably have already gotten rid of the Election Infection from the history books.
Surprised, and happy, that they have not being axed with other police shows. Bravo.
Blue bloods and ncis are my cop shows. Neither have been awful, Blue Bloods has been better
You mean we don't punish the 99% for what the less than 1% did?  It's almost like you are against discrimination.
I wouldn't say that 99 percent of them are incredible heroes. They are ordinary people like everyone else. There are really good ones who go out of their way to help people and put themselves at risk when they don't have to to save others, there are those that are bullies on a power trip, and then most of them are just ordinary people trying to do their jobs like anyone else, some better than others. The problem is that people don't see them as normal people anymore, and often think that they all are either evil oppressors or heroic defenders. The truth is in the middle.
 DISCRIMINATION in any form is wrong. I'm just saying that the media skews the world view and lately it's been police are the bad guys.. And they don't take the time to segregate the good guys from the bad guys. And yes those police officers that have committed stupid acts of discrimination need to be held accountable.. But remind people that they are in the significant minority.. Did that clarify my comment?
That show looked incredibly dumb from the beginning though
Socialism is incompatible with American culture imo. However, many people who support socialism use Canada as an example, and as a Canadian I can 100% ensure you that we are not socialist.Edit: For non-flaired users challenging me, 2/3 of our income tax goes to healthcare, and our annual contributions could be anywhere between 6,000 and 38,000 per person per year depending on income.
Democrats actually don't practice Socialism nor want it in its true form. It's what I call American Democrat Socialism. Look at Sweden and other countries where it does just fine. The problem is American Democrats are picking and choosing fashionable quotes and services from it, then marketing it to the young and dumb.Democrats are simply using another form of government which they know their supporters know absolutely nothing about...then create a fantasy that everything is going to be free and "everyone deserves X", and the justification for that "free stuff" is going to be perpetual misery that amazingly never ends but the wealthy always coincidentally are immune from.Imagine that.
>"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or free country. Socialism is just the beginning for these people. They want to go into a communistic form of government," he said.
That's because for some idiotic reason America (and by extension, leftists) associates social democracy (that is, free market economy with a huge welfare backbone for society) with socialism. Socialism is anti-democratic and has no place anywhere in the West. Social democracy already is in effect in many European countries.Note that I'm not saying America should follow social democracy or anything like that, just pointing out that equating social democracy and socialism (thus misrepresenting the former) doesn't do us any favors. To criticize something one must correctly identify it first.
What are we supposed to do? Rebel against the democratically-elected government? That's kinda treason bro
Fratello, I agree. They think we have free healthcare. It's free in the sense that you dont have to the the cashier, but we pay a portion towards it with every hour we work. Even if the demands of an increased minimum wage were to be met, the consequences are increase product and production costs that will also be taxed to fund healthcare.
> It's free in the sense that you dont have to the the cashier, but we pay a portion towards it with every hour we work.When I was in school, I was involved with the [Christian Campus Fellowship].  CCF offered lunch for students one day a week. "Free" was never used, and anyone that did call it "free" was quickly corrected-- it was "no charge," not "free."  Someone was paying for it.
Well, I don't think there's any question Biden won the election. And even if someone shouldn't have won the election, if the electoral college meets and elects him anyway, he is still the legitimate president. See: the 2000 election where in reality Gore should have won, but we did not have an armed insurrection throw Bush out months later.I like the Second Amendment, but yeah, it's still treason. I support the idea of being able to resist the United States if it turns corrupt, but we're nowhere near there. Lots of rebellions have started with that justification and none of them have gone well.
No, they want capitalism with robust welfare systems.
Which is what social democracy is (at least as far as I know)
Legislators don't handle that at all. If there was fraud, Trump should have filed a case showing the evidence and the trial court should make a determination within a week. But it's been over a month, Trump has shown no evidence in court, and he's lost all cases of importance. It *is* like the evidence doesn't even exist.
What do you think legislators do?Isn't the only "win" *Trump v. Boockvar*? That isn't even finally decided yet and is over an inconsequential number of votes. It doesn't have anything to do with fraud. What am I missing then? What cases do you think are promising?
I've read 2 articles.  Both of them dated the 7th which is today.  One says the audit was denied.  The other says there will be an audit.  Which one should I believe?
So the article was from yesterday, do we know if they started the audit today or yesterday and do we have findings? Also I really hope this does end the corrupt left for good.
oh look it's that Michigan case that just one hour ago leftists were telling me was dismissed "with prejudice"I patiently await them showing up with more lies to cover up their earlier lies.the destruction of the democrat party in slow motion
Which ever one confirms your bias I guess
>the destruction of the democrat party in slow motionWhat a time to be alive
Trust him.I watched an episode of CSI: Podunk, or one of them cna never remember the names, and one of the Mary Sue multi-culti scientists made an offhand remark about forensics or something.  So I ***know*** forensics, and this guy is right on the money.
I really thought this was the bee
Getting scolded by Santa really is the shittiest cherry on top of the shittiest cake of a year. Poor kid.
It's A NERF GUN for Christ sake.  this guy really chose to shatter a kids fantasy world over taking a stand against a 5 year old against fake guns.
Do not worry folks. This disgusting display right here is not that widespread. I currently work part-time at my local Walmart (I recently moved due to college and had to change jobs) and I have been swamped with multiple requests from parents to direct them to the toy isle for NERF guns. Folks are still buying these and kids are having fun despite lib propaganda.
Can we get a "NOT SATIRE" tag?
What the hell are we doing?  Honestly. What reality is this?
This is where as a dad you tell your son, that Santa doesn't know what he's talking about, then assure him that daddy will gladly buy him his gun for Christmas. That is if you can keep you composure and not KTFO Santa.
I have a coworker who confiscates her son's birthday presents if they involve a weapon (she was complaining about an action figure Batman he got)Buncha pansies.
I'd love to know what Santa thinks about NORAD protecting his flight path year after year. Those very real guns are okay, but a NERF gun isn't?
Can we crowdfund a complete Nerf armory for this boy and have it delivered by a real Santa?
Thank God the kid did not ask for a GI Joe, lest Santa feel compelled to deliver a lecture on toxic masculinity.
And then Dad beat the shit out of Santa and was correct to do so.
This isn't liberal so much as it is ignorant of how children learn. Giving a kid a toy gun doesn't make them a killer, it lets them explore complex ideas safely. Santa is a moron who upset that poor kid for his own little idiot crusade.
Eons ago boys would pick up sticks and pretend they are swords.  Now they will pick up sticks and pretend they are guns.  Who cares? Also not this dudes place.  His job is to go ho ho ho ok little boy.  I hope his parents get him a nerf gun and say we killed Santa with it.
Santas a little bitch this year
The elves should get together and frag the fat man.
Yep. Same here. 100% bee material
I don't even know any left leaning liberal person who would be pleased with this. This dude is absolutely off his rocker. Like its a toy? It's fun! It doesn't mean he'll kill people? I really don't understand his thought process behind being a dick to that kid
I mean I would've just broke his jaw but that works too lol
It isn't widespread until it **is**."Don't worry, teachers pressuring young boys into declaring they are girls isn't that widespread!"\-Conservatives 4 years ago.
My wife and I legit just bought nerf guns for our kids this year and all our cousins
With real headlines now being indistinguishable from satire articles a "NOT SATIRE" tag would be incredibly helpful. There's a sentence I never thought I would have to type.
Give me a link and I'll give towards that. Fricken douchebag Santa has no right crushing a kids dream
No part of this seems fake whatsoever...
What the fuck are you talking about? Liberals are literally the ones that are into that sick stuff...
Hunter Biden and Anthony Weiner have entered the chat.
Liberals really don't seem to know the difference.  They're too busy being terrified
That kid has great taste if that is what they asked for
Three round burst only until you are 21.That's how it works, right?
In his defense, Santa also turned down my request for a full auto M4A1 Suppressed with an under barrel grenade launcher so at least he's consistent.
If I were Santa I'd give that too but with decoy grenades that don't actually blow up.
Nerf guns were so much fun as a kid. I'm jealous of how complex the guns have now gotten, I always got the basic ones haha.
Well, the kid wanted a Phased Plasma Rifle in the 40 watt range, but just what you see kid.
Made me chuckle, have my upvote!
These are the ATF/NFA regulations we need
Yes, they are.And trying to keep it secret from parents.Then you have this weirdo.
It's about power.. You see what they want to do. They want to rise an army of young uneducated college age kids storm the streets.. They can't have armed Americans standing in their way.. They want to disarm the American people so that they can try t seize power
THEY understand perfectly well. They just hope you or others listening won't.
I feel old now....I was in iraq in 03
If they do, they better not vote for an asshole like Andrew gillum next time
It's only a matter of time before Florida is ruined too, soon we won't have anywhere to live.
New York becoming a ghost town right in front of our eyes thanks to the great leadership of the Democrats in charge
This is bitter sweet. I live in the little brother state Connecticut and A LOT of companies/factories are jumping ship to Southern states because unjustifiable taxes and restrictions are a burden too heavy to bare. Its going to be rough in the coming years for New England but I pray that the population will finally start to realize the Governors are killing their states.
Fucking stop leaving your blue states! You voted for this shit. You live with it.
Please no!!!!!!  Don't ruin my state.
More evidence that the economy is going to tank starting January 21 2021! Then Biden will blame it on President Trump! The beginning of the end!
Many NY executives have email signatures with FL addresses nowadays
No! No, no, no! New Yorkers need to stay away. Fix your own state or go to Georgia!
Yet in the most recent election it went more red than it has in 16 years
New Yorkers have been moving to Florida since the 70s. Usually retirees.
And NASDAQ to Texas was just mentioned recently.
My thoughts exactly. Damn people are stupid.
Just like liberals fleeing Cali and ruining the surrounding states. The stupidity of leaving due to failed policies and then voting for said policies hurts my neocortex.
For now.If insane leftists keep moving there...
The problem is that these leftists move to Florida, drive the cost of everything up, then bring their shitty politics with them.  Florida came way too close in the last gubernatorial election to voting in a crackhead who loves gay prostitutes.
No worries, they are coming to ruin every state possible. I think Texas is certainly next, didn't win it by much this time.
It's actually conservatives fleeing cali because they realize cali will never change in their favor.
No, this is an entrenched Democrat governance issue.  Even a RINO governor couldn't screw up this bad.  See Illinois/Chicago or Maryland/Baltimore, there are more examples.
The way it goes is that Republicans make a place a great place to live, like California, Texas, Florida, etc., and then democrats migrate there and ruin the place. Sure it takes a while for stuff to get bad, but people flee blue states en masse to red states all over the country.
Democrats underestimated Trump,  didn't stuff enough ballots.
Interesting.Can you give me an example from history of a state that was "made place a great place to live", was flooded by left-leaning populace, and then fled the state again?Also, who/what time in particular was behind making say CA & NY the economic powerhouses they are today?
They had a targeted plan that worked. They obviously couldn't cheat everywhere or that would be too obvious. They targeted 4 cities and that was all it took to elect sleepy Joe.
Marty (mayor) is a Democrat and Baker (governor) is a rhino. He does everything to appease the Democrat politicians in the state.
NY is the closest port to Europe. California has the closest ports to Asia. They're wealthy primarily due to geography and in California's case climate. California has the highest taxes in the US, $2 trillion in debt, receives 1/3rd of all federal welfare spending, and has 1/3rd of the homeless population. Around 700-800 businesses leave California annually and the domestic population has been decreasing for two decades.
CaliforniaNew Yorkboth were literally run by Republicans and NYCs prosperity is literally due to one republican (Rudy Guiliani) who saved it from turning into DetroitCA and NY became prosperous cause they offered stable business conditions and CA had good weather. Then Dems got elected and have been doing everything in their power to make the states thieving welfare states that prevent progress. All this time they also try to take credit for the success of FAANG etc. when nothing they have done has been useful to FAANG. Now their economies are finally crashing and Pelosi/Schumer want "Stimulus bills" to give free money to rent seeking parasites (unemployed) and state governments that spent the money they should have saved on welfare for lazy moochers.
Lmao. So funny right? What's funnier is that idiots like you think there wasn't anything funny going on.
The scam isn't what's sad, I expected fraud from Biden and the Dems. What's sad is all of you sheep that believe everything they are spoon fed from CNN.
You'll be just as wrong then. !remindme 8 years
He may be a commie but you have to admit that he usually tells the truth.
She's a fucking monster. None of these people care about us.
Good. Not one penny goes to the average needy american
> Nancy basically said she held upI wouldn't use the word basically because she came right out and said it.  And the people that need it the most are the same dumb fuckers that keep voting for cunts like her.  Good....they voted to get fucked and they got fucked.
that's why they are cheating to beat about the only one that does.
I'm asking this out of complete ignorance. Do police officers always draw their guns when conducting a warrant? It seem excessive to me that they would need to have guns out to conduct a warrant in which they are not arresting anybody. I have no idea on the validity of it but apparently shes claiming guns were pointed at her children? Either way the fact that these officers were brandishing guns in the presence of children when no one is threatening the safety of the officers (I'm assuming this since no one was detained) is fucking weird to me.
It happens. The warrant squad broke into my house and arrested me with shotguns in my face years ago. Someone with my last name was wanted for a violent crime in my area, including assault of a police officer, and there was a typo on their paperwork.        Explaining why I was arrested like Osama Bin Laden to my neighbors was fun. Side note, in Staten Island the restaraunt owner who refused to shut down was arrested in very similar circumstances by undercover sheriff's.
Well, everyone except for literally all of the flaired users that commented, who reacted exactly like that.
She was in the hallway dude. And at least one cop clearly pointed his gun up the stairs, where she just said there were kids.
Sounds like PR speak. Doesn't really say what exactly she was doing wrong. Unilaterally modifying the covid dashboard? Okay... why? What did she modify it to? Was the other dashboard suppressing case numbers?I'd be very interested to know what her co-workers have to say about her. I'm sure they'll be interviewed once this story blows up and is national news.
*Insubordination when pressured to manipulate public health data on the coronavirus pandemic FTFY
Firing I get. Idk if that's worth a raid tho man...
In your case they could think you are violent and dangerous to them.Here? There was no threat of violence.This kind of action could be very dangerous if the police thought they woman and her husband are members of NRA
She made up her own dashboard, and was making it publicly available.  Governments don't like when people who counter their "truth".
Maybe that's the blue wave the media hyped up
This is confirmed in the texts between the two local officials who talked about this
Someone clogged the pissbox to clear out a building? That's weak sauce.
So many people have tried to debunk the "suitcase" video. Shouldn't this fact, that the so-called "water main break" they claimed necessitated a stoppage in the count and an evacuation of the building, then clearly be a huge lie used as an excuse to remove election judges from the operation?
Just imagine the shenanigans that went down in that Arena that day
Another lie from Democrats. Imagine that...
This makes sense. Leftists call off classes for a week when they see a banana in a tree because it triggers them. I would believe that a leaky urinal would be enough to quit.
The pipe break was at 6am [Atlanta news, Nov 3]The video is around 10:30 PM.  It's probably unrelated.
Its actually not bullshit. Just human pee.
I am shocked. Shocked, I tell you.
Right ! Flushed all the Trump votes away unfortunately
Had me in the first half. Not gonna lie.
Call it essential viral body oils. They'll have injection parties with wine.

This is the best vaccine made anywhere there is nothing on the market with as much vaccine power as this vaccine has.
Omgosh and they even give you the cutest monogrammed tumbler after you pay a small startup fee of 7k today!!!!! Yaaaaasssssss Kweeeeeen!!!!!!#BossBabe #GirlPower #MomBoss
How often does Babylon Bee make fun of Republicans? I feel like their satire is always on the flip side
I think if we all go on Twitter and use #MeToo after getting it, it will make it easier.  Did you get the vaccine yet?  Yup, you?  Me too
Have you heard of botox parties? They already do.
I'm sure at least a dozen Utah housewives are already trying to sign up.
No no, it is Betsy's domain and she has the education portfolio. Azar has vaccine.
This must be day one of their training.
Dude I thought I was in the wrong subreddit. I think we found the common ground all of us can agree on. Holy shit the comments are gold lol
While they definitely lean heavily to the right, they do make fun of all sides, it's just rare that their articles making fun of conservatives get reposted here.
I would call this jesting at Republicans-- suburban Christian white women.
They make fun of everyone, scroll through their articles and you will see they go after all sides, even themselves at times.
That's because for the most part the flip side is the one more fun to rib but this is still kinda funny
Maybe you should visit this subreddit more frequently. There is more humor here than in the propaganda the left posts disguised as humor in r/politicalhumor.
Chill out man, being angry all the time like r/politics is lame.
Idk if you read the comments or not but... If you read them most of us are for a vaccine and want one.
Besides this obviously not being true, you're okay with Trump and Carson taking Regeneron something that is actually based on embryonic stem cells?
Thanks captain obvious!I think you have been stung by the bee.
Yeah but see botox is a poison that makes you "prettier" so that's fine. Vaccines are poison laced with microchips to make you sick and trackable. It's just not the same. /s
Not just wives, I have a buddy I went to high school with is sucked into one of those mlm things. You hate to see it.Edit: he _is_ from Utah, however.
Let me tell you how you can better your health and wellness plus make some money on the side!
Most Bee/Onion articles are like that; the headline is always the strongest joke.
That makes sense. Like I mentioned in another comment, even though I would consider myself a progressive voter, they crack me up regardless of their posts.
This was posted in R/polticalhumor which leans leftIm glad there are still things both sides can agree upon
Lol that sub hasn't had an actual joke posted in years, nothing but "conservative said a conservative opinion wow so funny they believe that"
I heard the vaccine contains 5g
Amway tried to get me when I was younger. Fortunately, when I went to their recruitment meeting the lead speaker was shit-faced and made a total ass out of himself on stage. He made fun of the reps who actually tried to sell Amway products instead of recruiting more idiots like me, and then invited his wife up there to make a poorly delivered joke about how he doesn't get enough blowjobs for how large her shoe collection is/was. She was visibly mortified by it. Then he tried to end the meeting in a prayer, but slurred his words so bad that it was almost completely incoherent. The guy who was trying to recruit me came running up as soon as it was over and said something about, "Sorry if that was a bit high-level, I didn't expect him to talk about the more advanced techniques for building downlines." I remember thinking, "Are you really just gonna gloss over the wasted degenerate embarrassing his wife and religion on stage?"Trap avoided.
Just before the acai berry fad hit a mutual acquaintance invited me to attend some seminar selling acai juice in an obvious pyramid scheme. The juice admittedly was pretty good, but the guys running it were trying to sell it off as some wonder tonic. One even said he fed it to his old dog and after a week it was running up and down stairs like it was young again. It was funny when I found out a few years later that acai berries aren't really any more nutritious than regular blue berries.
One of my college roommates came home with like six giant boxes of really gross juice. We were like "Ken, bro, what is with all this juice man?" Apparently he had been convinced he could sell it on campus. Spoiler alert, that wasn't allowed. So he ended up having to drink it all himself. We tried it, tasted gross and at least for me it caused me have the worst shits of my life. Thought I was going to die. I'll never forget it, but at least I'll never be the victim of a MLM again, hopefully.....
You are missing the joke I think. It's not anything against a Christian housewife. It's about MLM hunbots who shill essential oils, are anti-vaxxers, and believe their oils are more powerful than actual medicine.
Man, that was some high grade fight milk! Made with all the energy and protein of crow eggs! -FIGHT MILK
It's a little bit over half and half (55% Biden; 45% Trump). That's an estimate, though, and we all know how good the media is at math.
Why is it only the good people? - oh they have jobs and money.  " Lawrence was walking to his job at a local market when three suspects committed a robbery/homicide. In an instant, his life was over. "   The judge that let that animal out needs to be impeached from office.
Basically, the "safe harbor" date is tomorrow (12/8) and deadline for PA to respond to the most recent lawsuit filed by PA GOP members was originally set as 12/9.  The deadline has been moved up to coincide with the "safe harbor" date.
Care to elaborate more than that? Or are you just trying to stir up the anxiety?
Why couldn't it be contested before the election?
Care to actually read the story, or are you just gonna stay up in the peanut gallery
The dems want to burn up the time on clock, hoping to allow their state electoral boards to give the election to biden without any serious examinations of the vote fraud. It could work, if the courts are not quick to act, of if the courts dont make rulings to prevent the states from providing their electors. The odds of successfully preventing the steal are low, but we are not fully out of hope yet.
Not enough pictures for the dumbass.
Oh shit I thought they meant Captain Kirk lol
this particular case is not a "serious examination of voter fraud" though.  This suit is \*not\* about fraud; it is about constitutionality of mail in voting as it was done in PA (something they had no problem with when the law was passed in 2019 btw, nor in the 2020 primaries).They are seeking an outrageous amount of relief, ie. literally chucking out each and every mail in vote - literally disenfranching 2.5 million people.It is an incredibly long shot that SCOTUS would grant such relief.
Biden would still have enough EV to still win though , right?
Did any case get filed and thrown out for a lack of standing?
Once the ECV is cast it is decided. It doesn't matter if Biden comes out and admits he won through fraud after the fact. He would have to be impeached at that point. Courts cannot just remove him from office.
Probably shrug my shoulders and keep working to be honest.
They said they are not hearing oral arguments, which means they WILL dismiss it out of hand just as in the other states.
My prediction: chicken-shit judges would rather let cheating stand than take the heat of invalidating the "election".
The lower court held a hearing and issued an order with findings of fact. The Arizona Supreme Court will very likely affirm. Either tonight or tomorrow is my guess.
Agreed.  If it should be overturned and is overturned there will be a national meltdown like you've never seen before...likely violent
I don't know why you are downvoted, but you are right.We are too comfortable to ever have a civil war no matter what happens.  Until we have no job, no home with a tv / internet / food to go back to, there will never be a civil war.
I WONDER IF SHE REGRETTED HER VOTING CHOICES WHEN SHE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO DIE.
Yea but shes white... so how much does her life really matter?
Good job defund the police-ers. You officially have blood on your hands and this is only the beginning.Defund any politician who says defund the police.
The defund the police experiment is proceeding as expected
Quick! Someone call another social worker!
This is sad.Sad because she thought she could make a difference and maybe even was a supporter of the defund the police movement, but still completely unprepared for the real world. I seriously doubt the people signing up for that duty think they may not come home that night, but maybe, just maybe, with the interaction of the inevitable, they will come to see the need for the men and women willing to protect us at all costs. I am all for real world threat matrix training - read - not progressive brainwashing. We can do better. I just hope not too many wide-eyed change the world social workers have to die before we all get on the same page.
I like her in a mask, she doesn't look so....mouthy
Wallace is following Shepard Smith lead on how to exit Fox
If they didn't fear the results were contested,  they wouldn't bother forcing other people to 'concede' to Biden's media dubbed president-elect status
Except that he's not the president-elect?The AP does not decide who wins or loses an election, as much as they apparently desire that power.
Chris Wallace is a disgusting creature.
He ain't the president elect until the Electoral College says he's the president elect. What part of "the Constitution didn't give the media the power to officially decide an election" don't these people understand?
Wallace always looks/acts like he's either on his way up or on his way down from a drunken bender.
It's true that Trump is contesting the election, but people seem misled on his legal arguments.The problem moderates and Democrats have is this - he's not really claiming fraud cost him the election in court. He claims fraud in public, but his main argument in court is that mail in ballots represent a different class of voter (basically that mail in votes are given preferential treatment over in person voting). I think it's a weak argument, but what happens if Trump's legal argument succeeds?If Trump succeeds and mail in ballots are considered to be given preferential treatment, he can invalidate the results of the election. He's not claiming those votes are fraudulent in court, only that mail in ballots should not be allowed. He's arguing that votes cast by American citizens using mail in ballots should not count. He's not arguing that they were cast by someone other than who the ballot was issued to. He's not arguing that those ballots are fake or fraudulent. He's arguing that mail in votes simply shouldn't count. He's arguing that if you voted by mail, your vote doesn't count. His fraud speech in public is his political cover, but he doesn't argue fraud in court. In court, he's just trying to invalidate the results of the election based on the argument that mail in votes created a seperate class of vote.Many states have laws on the books that pick their electoral college delegates based on the outcome of the popular vote for president in the state. For example, Texas goes red; the Republicans choose the delegates. Those delegates then vote for Trump.  Illinois goes blue, Democrats pick the delegates who vote for Biden.  Those laws were put in place by representatives within the state to decide how that state will choose their president. If Trump succeeds in invalidating the results of the election, state laws are no longer useful. The state could choose whoever they want. (Side note: Trump is banking on them choosing him in this instance. In reality, they could all just vote for Biden).So let's say that Trump convinces the Supreme Court to rule that mail in ballots are a seperate class of voter (preferential treatment). Those are still votes cast by real Americans that are being invalidated over a process. Americans followed a process laid out by their State, in good faith, and now their votes don't count. State protections put in place to make sure delegates vote the way the people voted are now useless. Power has been taken away from the people of that state. That's why some conservatives are turning on Trump. It's a very dangerous legal precedent.It makes sense to invalidate results if there was widespread fraud, but Trump isn't arguing fraud in court. That's the disconnect. Trump needs to argue fraud in court or concede. We need an independent investigation regardless for peace of mind. His current legal argument is nothing more than an attempt to nullify a state election with votes only cast by American citizens of that state. He's not alleging that any significant number of votes were cast in someone else's name or that something devious occurred. His lawyers are not arguing that Democrats committed fraud by voting in someone else's name, that your vote was somehow switched, or any other devious attempt by the Democrats. **His argument is that mail in votes should be illegal. That's why the slogan is count all the "legal" votes rather than "non-fraudulent" votes.** He's hoping to make mail in ballots illegal because they cost him the election. Thus "legal" votes wouldn't include the millions of Americans who voted by mail if Trump wins his lawsuit. It's ultimately an attempt by the leader of the federal executive branch to make a state law ineffective. Then he can have loyal state officials choose delegates to elect him. That's why a lot of moderate conservatives have abandoned Trump. Many moderates on the right view it as an overreach by the head of the federal executive branch on state rights. Many on the left view it as a legal maneuver, but a moral outrage.
Next, people will be pressured to put "Biden is my president" in their Twitter bio just like their pronouns.
Just another way to force people to bend the knee
4 years ago this sub had no problems calling Trump "president" and "president-elect" all through November.
However we never complained 4 years ago about this. Saying things like this makes us look like hypocrites.
But he is in the office of President-elect /s
You mean like how Hillary conceded to Trump on election night?
At some point you're hitting next-level pedantry. I'm *quite* sure that if I look on here 4 years ago, Trump was being called "president elect" and more by this point. (I did, and he was.)
As a matter of interest do you know when people starting referring to Trump as president elect after the 2016 election?  Was it only after the electoral college confirmation?
He does still retain the title of Vice President just with a former on it
When you hold a position of office, you retain the title. Vice President Joe Biden is appropriate.So is President Trump, President Clinton, etc.
President, vice-president, and cabinet positions are retained even after term out of respect.Bush and Obama are still referred to as "Mr. President", as Trump will be.EDIT: I was being snarky, and fact-check shows me wrong, so I shall eat my humble-pie. Miss Manners informs me that Bush should be reverted to "Gov. Bush", and that this dates even to Washington who-- reasoning that there could only be one President-- reverted to "General Washington" post-term.
>What's the difference this time?The election results are being disputed this time.  When Trump and Obama won, nobody disputed the results.
He literally is. He has been elected president by the people, but he has not been inducted into office yet. The formalities like the electoral college haven't been performed yet, but the election has been decided for all practical purposes.
Technical answer: From a legal definition, no. He won't be until the electoral college votes next week. That's technically how all president elects work.From a general use/practical standpoint: Yes. Enough states have certified that he has the 270 votes needed already, and they just haven't voted yet. We've used the term "presidential elect" in this context for a long time.
Ha I was just arguing about profile gender pronouns with someone. About how its nothing but virtue signaling and trying to show how woke you are.
If Biden were the only candidate remaining, I wouldn't have any issue with calling him President elect. President Trump hasn't conceded, so Biden isn't the only candidate...not the same situation as four years ago...
When ballot counters are lawyering up, I think it is fair to say that the election is still in dispute.Which is why Democrats like Chris Wallace are pushing so hard to force people to say Biden is "president-elect".
As a reminder, he does not become president elect until the electors have been certified. They have not yet been certified.
Because this is the language that has been used for presumptive president-elects since before the internet was a thing.Go find some threads on this sub from 4 years ago, Trump was being called "president" here in November. Yall are being ridiculously pedantic and hypocritical here.
False. The Electoral College hasn't met yet.
It's been done by the media in every election for like 50 years but apparently now for reasons totally unknown we have to make an exception.
I have a couple coworkers who put that shit in their email signatures, cringe as fuck. Thanks Tammy, I now know not to address you as a dude.
So if Clinton were sore loser unwilling to face the reality, then it would've been OK? Gimme a break...
That's not true. President-Elect is not an official term, and candidates have used it following the election for years. Trump used it in November of 2016.There are no rules for when you can call yourself President-Elect because it's just a convenient title people began using in the media decades ago to refer to the apparent winner of the election. The "apparent winner of the election" IS an official designation as determined by the GSA for transition purposes. The GSA with the support of President Trump has made that determination.
You are correct that she conceded the day after the election was held, rather than the night of the election. According to reports, she called to congratulate Trump around 2:30am the morning after the election (shortly after the AP projected Trump as the winner). She didn't actually give the speech until later on that day though. Hillary conceded in public rather than claiming she won. As far as the legal challenges, I'm not sure what you're referring to? I know the Green Party paid for recounts in a few states, but I'm not sure what lawsuits you are talking about? Educate me please.
Way longer then 50 years. President-elect has been used to refer to the winner as called by the AP since Taylor v. Cass in 1848.
Everyone is acting like a child in this situation, Wallace shouldn't be on a high horse about it and Azar should quit being petty.Sometimes I come on the internet for a break from dealing with 3 year olds, only to have to see more of the same behavior. Can everyone go stand in the corner for a few minutes until they chill out?
I've responded to this a dozen times, but again: If you want to go by what the Constitution says, concession doesn't mean diddly. Trump has to hit a majority of electoral votes to become president-elect / president, and Clinton's concession does not change that. If he failed to hit 270, and *if* Clinton were removed from the ballot (which would probably trigger a special election), third party candidates would be in play.Clinton does not have the constitutional power to declare Trump the winner. Only the combined EC or House has that power.
Every election in history was contested by someone. No court, nor the AG, nor any intelligence agencies, nor even the recounts performed so far are giving any reason to doubt the results.Who cares what the MSM / google are doing. They happen to be colloquially correct in their everyday usage of "president elect", and if someone wants to pick nits over constitutionality I just hope theyre being consistent.
Concession is not a constitutional anything, so while we're talking about what powers "the Constitution didn't give", it certainly did not give Clinton the power to declare Trump the winner. It simply expedites the transition process.270 electoral votes cast in accordance with state rules makes the president.
It seems its been convention for a very long time though and in all honesty I don't see why it matters that much.  If for some reason the electoral college did go against the person who had appeared to be president elect up until that point why would it matter that people referred to that person as president elect for a short time?  It would ultimately end up being meaningless in the scheme of things.
Nothing is "required" but that's how our system and language work. You're certainly free to make up your own rules if it makes you happy.EDIT: I was being snarky, and fact-check shows me wrong, so I shall eat my humble-pie. Miss Manners informs me that Bush should be reverted to "Gov. Bush", and that this dates even to Washington who-- reasoning that there could only be one President-- reverted to "General Washington" post-term. The more you know!
If it isn't an official term, then Chris Wallace has no business insisting someone use it.But Wallace is a partisan hack shilling for the DNC, so he will anyway.
It's still a word with a definition which he meets though.
Let me guess, by evidence you mean the drunk lady who is on probation for a computer crime and the other guy who sees ghosts? And the famous 90 second video. You guys are just deluding yourself if you think Biden is not the president elect. Why do you Trump has been stingy when it comes to spending on challenging the election?
Lol you really pulled up an online thesaurus and copy-pasted huh?
Clinton conceded the day after: 
Your fellow Trump supporters have repeatedly assured me that Democrats are cannibalistic pedophiles; that climate change is merely a Chinese hoax; that doctors and hospitals are fabricating COVID deaths for cash; that Sandy Hook was just a left wing, anti-gun hoax; that Barak Obama is actually a Kenyan born Muslim; that Michelle Obama is actually a man; that there is some kind of deep state conspiring against Trump; that Trump actually does have a healthcare plan he's going to reveal in two weeks; that Islamic terrorists were flooding across the Mexican border; that Obamacare was going to result in "death panels"; that George Soros is behind all the BLM protests.You guys have perfected "fake news".  Heal yourselves before pointing fingers.
Once they figure out why "Elliot" page playing a gay woman on Netlfix is OK when "he" is not a gay woman any more.
Hey, Trump is the one copying Clinton. I hate them both. Obviously both Trump and Biden will have been legitimate presidents.
[Too bad it's not their decision to make.]
With all the blatant fraud that's happened and has been brought forward,  it would be a greater travesty of justice to not investigate fully. If we are going to accept mass voter fraud why have elections?
Can't see the line can you Russ?
Chase is a liberal cunt. A hilarious cunt, but a cunt nonetheless.
So basically the moron in the video wants to curtail the 1st Amendment because Libs are funnier than him? That's really his argument? Comedy gold.
Sorry I skipped the seminar on "spew out a bunch of random buzz words".
That would be fuck --- king epic.
If he does this, I'll have infinite respect form Ted Cruz. He'd be one of the handful of "Republicans" that'd be good in my books going forward, even if I disagree with him on some issues.
When you grow thr beard, you become the badass.  This is the way.
^ this. He is definitely proving himself as of late. Glad to see somebody stand with our President.
This is the battlefield. There will be no others if we don't win this one.
Me too. Cruz is a master tactician for sure, but if it was between the two of them Trump would get my vote.
Can anyone tell me the moment in time late night became MSNBC and libs just started jerking off to themselves? Does anyone actually do real comedy anymore?
This is what the talking heads never understand.  These TV figures, news casters, teachers, medical staff, politicians...none of them loses so much as a paycheck as a result of the lockdowns.Take davidson's paycheck away for a few months and see how he feels then.  I'd imagine all that cocaine doesn't just pay for itself.
Pete Davidson is a tool.  Nobody should listen to what he has to say.
His claim to fame is dating ariana grande. His stand up sucks, and his best character on SNL only says one word.Pete. Your father died trying to save peoples lives as a firefighter. Did you inherit any of his courage?
Oh? Is pete Davidson being an unfunny elitist snot again? Id like to see how *that* non apology goes. No I dont. Fuck her.
Pete Davidson - he's a guy who gets laughed at. Nobody thinks he is a serious actor or comedian.It was impressive he got the attention of Ariana Grande for even a day, though, but even David Spade got supermodels simply for appearing on Saturday Night Live.But yeah. People who aren't subject to lockdowns, or who are filthy rich, seem to have a really hard time empathising with those who lose everything thanks to Covid-19.
The worst part about this is SNL is somehow allowed to broadcast during COVID* Dozens of unmasked workers* In close proximity to each other* Inside* Taping in front of a live audience* Who are sitting in rows close to each otherThey allow this but shut down schools. WTF.
Well he has Hillary Clinton's face tatted on his body, so... no surprise there. Dude's a fucking joke. A bad one. Just like SNL.
Be aware that Davidson is saying what most of Hollywood and other media people think of the American working class. The arrogance and dislike is hidden most of the time. One thing I have come to realize is that  the Democrats have been seen as champions for the little guy and Republicans are seen as champions for the elite. I think the last four years and especially the pandemic have shown that the true friends of working people are conservatives and the liberals align with the elite and powerful.
Douchebag lives in NY and walks by closed up businesses everyday and is too stupid to realize that somebody's dream died. Just another clueless tard.
I'm not saying this to pile on and I realize comedy is subjective but I find absolutely nothing funny about Pete Davidson.Comedy has all kinds of coping mechanisms for both the comedian and the audience but there was always something classless and cheap about using the death of his own father, a firefighter that died in 9/11, within a bit. I think that incapsulates his lack of range to find funny.The dude is banging Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale so what do I know.
First off, I never understood the Pete Davidson hype. I swear people just pretended like he was a super funny guy after he got dumped by Ariana Grande.Second, I really can't believe SNL has decided to go this hard left. I thought 2016 was unbearable and they looked like fools after Trump won, but now they're really doubling down and it's just sad to watch. Their cold opens are always political and rarely funny anymore, and this is coming from someone who thought Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer was hilarious. They should honestly do that with Kayleigh because she's way more aggressive with the press than Sean ever was.
Pete Davidson is a huge ass clown and is still the biggest piece of trash to come from Staten Island.
I swear this guy will get his one day. Just takes time.
I thought he was the King of Staten Island? I hope Colin Robinson and Nandor the rentless go visit him but not to make him immortal but just use him as food.
He's a dumb piece of shit
Is Pete Davidson genetically predisposed to be a smug unfunny asshat? It seems to be the only thing he is good at.
And these people think they are the counterculture
He's a fucking idiot and deserves to get a beat down by one of those bar owners
I bet Pete Davidson's dad actually climbed UP the tower because his son was Pete Davidson.
It was in 2008 when SNL took the first hard turn. Before that they leveled the punches 60/40 split. In 2008 it dropped to about 90/10
Rough take ... but not wrong. A guy whose livelihood has been completely unaffected by the pandemic should not be taking pot shots at people who stand to lose everything - even if they are doing the wrong thing themselves.Davidson could and should have easily called out the failure of the folks implementing the restrictions to provide adequate support to the small businesses most negatively affected.
You forgot about his asshole eyes
Tbh, I felt like Mad TV was better anyways.
Liberals do. Pretty sure most conservatives stopped watching. They haven't been funny since they lost Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and Andy Samberg.
Interesting.  Been wondering why he's the media darling all of a sudden (a while back).  Such a weird, uninteresting choice.  Like, to the point of some media mogul making a bet with another that they could make somebody a super star?  "Go ahead!  Name somebody!  They've got to be a working actor though."
I mean, is it really courage he is lacking? Or just common fucking sense?
Guy managed to screw that up, given that he had to brag to Mac Miller about it.I would think that if someone is in a relationship with someone who makes them happy, they wouldn't need to rub that in someone else's face out of spite.But I mean maybe a little humility is in short supply.
He admitted he wasn't very close with his father.. it shows
Yeah, people forget that David Spade was a ladies man. Fame gets you far. Pete Davidson is underperforming. Just look at that douche Colin Jost.
We are in a post truth society. The left believes whatever they are told to. - investigative journalism dead- questioning the status quo dead- believing that anyone who holds an opposite view is a nazi. Madness
Eh both parties suck the cock of big money interests over the working class. Democrats are just 2 faced about it, Republicans less so.
Who's "starting violence" over this? Why does he get free speech but we can't use our free speech to criticize what he says?
>in the end we are all going to need to have each other's backsFuck that. The democrats spent 6 months allowing rioters to burn down tens of thousands of innocent people's livelihoods, and now enforce rules they themselves don't follow, sinking small businesses and propping up hollywood.We are divided, and it was the left that divided us. I don't want to have their backs, and they clearly don't have ours. They made themselves the enemy. Unity is dead.
Apparently the government forcing you to close your business is the free marketLearn something new every day
SNL with their "You can see Russia from my hoouse" convinced people to this day that she actually said that. They realized the power they had at that moment and ran with it.
If it's not Celebrity Jeopardy, it's crap.
It was long before that but less over,  it's just that the left hadn't completely made EVERYTHING political until around 2008.  9/11, terror, and the state of war also affected the culture.What's happened in recent years though, the generation changed.Idiots like Pete Davidson were little kids on 9/11.   His big 'claim to fame' was making joke about how his father died that day.  They don't have any love for country, their completely brainwashed and radicalized, and that lack of love of country comes right through.In the 90s, Norm MacDonald imitated Bob Dole.  It was pretty sharp stuff, Norm is a Canadian, but fundamentally, he liked Bob Dole.  He didn't know about the politics, but he recognized him as being a solid man, a war hero, and from a more rugged generation of men.  These new comedians are just empty vessels of hate.
I don't think there's anything wrong with mocking something that many perceive as ridiculous, just as long as you do the same for both sides.Joe Biden is a treasure trove of comedy sketches (at least as much as Trump is) and they haven't mocked him once.
It's not about changing hearts or minds.&#x200B;It's about entertaining themselves, and their circle of woke friends.   And that's why it's simply not funny for most of the viewers. It's base level thinking.&#x200B;George Carlin used his comedy to get audiences to think about things. It takes talent to cleverly poke fun at and about ideas, concepts, people... but do so in a way that makes people laugh now, but think later.
It's along the lines of the whole "they don't believe in science" thing, and "reality has a liberal bias". Brand assassination. Our team is great, and so are you if you affiliate yourself with us. Otherwise you're subject to these stereotypes which will be leveled against you with the full weight of our mass media machine. Ridicule for being on the "wrong" team can be pretty persuasive, especially for young people who tend to be more concerned with peer approval.
Liberals waste money more than conservatives. Catering to them will get you more advertising dollars.
In Living Color was great too.
I grew up in the 80's and 90's, so SNL was it for me.  I think MAD TV started mid 90's and it was very good too.
He was 7 when his father died...
They did it before that. Chevy Chase made the entire world think that Gerald Ford was a bumbling buffoon. Gerald Ford in actuality is probably one of the best athletes to ever be President of the United States but you wouldn't know that because of SNL.
They knew that poking fun at Obama would have gotten them all branded as racists, the same as *everybody else* who who ever criticized Mr. "Scandal-Free".
The Black Jeopardy with Tom Hanks was amazing
What makes comedy funny is the self-deprecating nature, making good observations, and making light of situations. SNL now just bashes stuff because they are blinded by partisanship.
Biden is an easy target so your theory will be put to the test.
SNL didn't criticize or riff on anything Obama did because he was black. Full stop. And people talk about "white privilege".
Obama was charming and charismatic, no. SNL managed to do Bill Clinton fine and he oozes charm and charisma.
He is dearly missed. Showed my kids some old episodes and they about died.
In living color was the best. I still quote stuff from their sketches.
No. Everything you just said is wrong. Maybe deal with violence? They've been using violence! Saving one is worth it? That's childish. Save one while tens of thousands of innocent American's livelihoods go up in flames?You're probably not a conservative, but if you are, you are an immature one. These people will dig up the hatchet and stick it in your neck, and it will have been your naivety that's to blame.No more unity. No more ceding. All of that is over. The next time they use violence against us, it needs to be met with a more severe violence. We need to defend ourselves.
Wait till Nikki Haley runs. Women will be stupid again.
Nothing has changed. Had she had a D after her name they would have sung her praises.
I remember the left freaking out because of the poll boost Nixon got from appearing on Laugh In.  Their concern for politics over doing their jobs (entertaining) is nothing new.
You're butchering her argument and you clearly still don't even get it.Alaska is the ONLY US state to border a hostile nation. Her point was that, unlike governors in the other 49 states, she was much more well versed in geopolitics. This is because she _had_ to be, given that Alaska is the area of first contact with Russia. When Russian fighters buzz US airspace, or Russian navy vessels infringe on US territory, it's the Alaskan governor on the front line of a response. It's her national guard that would be activated, her cities that would be bombed, her people who would die. No other governor had that experience, which was her whole point. Somehow that got turned into what you described. Palin was a troubled candidate to be sure, but this entire disinformation campaign is terrible.
>Palin said something similar thoughThat's not even close to the same thing.Saying you can see Russia from parts of Alaska puts into perspective just how close Alaska is to Russia and how as governor she would have a lot of indirect experience in dealing with Russia. Clearly as governor she isn't like sitting down for meetings with Putin or anything, but Russia is always fucking with our airspace and most of the time it's with Alaska.Claiming she said "I can see Russia from my house!" just makes her sound like a child, which of course was the entire point.
Check out legion of Skanks who prick davidson was on a few times very early on before he got big and left his friends behind. Surprised the woke crowd hasn't gone after him for appearing on there years back. Davidson has always been shit, fuck.. anyone who would get a Hillary tattoo sold out in their man card along time ago.
Liberals tend to be younger. Younger people waste more money. This isn't a controversial statement. That's why the 18-35 year old demographic is the most valuable to advertisers.
Also made fun of someone with 1 eye.
This is a thread about the comedian.  There is plenty of anger to go around.
Why wait? Every openly conservative woman gets degraded by the party of tolerance. Look at the difference in how reddit/twitter react to criticism against Michelle Obama vs Candace Owens.
And among those calling her stupid, Kamala Harris will be the loudest.
They won't be able to do that though since their side will have a woman in the oval office
In fairness Haley is clearly very smart... Palin was truly dumb as a brick.
Physically bumbling is what was meant (e.g., Chase as Ford would trip all the time, even though Ford was a great athlete who played D1 college football at U of ~~M~~ichigan).
They haven't torn up Jimmy Kimmel for "The Man Show" yet.So, I'm going to guess it's politically convenient targets they go after.
Right because of the lame stream media telling you that. Sarah Palin is as smart as the next smart woman
Not gonna lie when he actually brought in Crenshaw to roast him my opinion of him went up a lot. He actually apologized and did in in a hilarious way.And he let Crenshaw roast him. My God the poor boy needed to go to a hospital to treat the third degree burns Crenshaw gave him. Link for anyone who has not seen it 
Windawasha said *conservative*. Democrats consider Collins to be their useful idiot RINO.
I based my opinion exclusively on watching her talk.   She struck me as dumb as a log.   There are plenty of dumb democrats too.
If I remember correctly later on he publicly said he regretted bringing him on the show
And just like that the little bit of respect I was starting to have for him is gone.
Now you know why the Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, Banks, Wall Street and Hollywood are now readily willing to dump and betray their own people and nation for Chinese money.
Time to start handing out treason charges.No mercy.
I like how left media always reports incredible information from anonymous sources while incredible information from actual people get ignored.
This is fascinating because a hundred years ago that's what some Chinese people believed their leaders at the time we doing with foreign interests. Perhaps they learned from that history and weaponized it for their own benefit this time.
CNN : breaking news, trump once again showing his racism and white supremacy by hinting that lives of non American citizens have no value and do not matter
Ah yes, Trump is gonna prioritize a vaccine produced and developed by a German biotechnology company and pretend like he - or any American for that matter - had anything to do with it at all. Operating Warp Speed my ass. Media is doing a fine job of manipulating the facts by calling it the Pfizer vaccine instead of the BioNTech vaccine.
They'll blame Trump for this shit, too.
How many were wiped out from Antifa and BLM?
Not COVID19, more like Democrat run states and cities panicking and overreaching with some doing everything they can to fuck up the economy so they could drag Biden's walking pedo corpse across the finish line
If you support lockdowns you're a fuckin idiot. Sadists
\*Governor bans your job even though 99.99% of people are completely safe\*"Goddamn Trump! He failed!"How exactly? Nobody can explain.
At his age I think he either is fine, or close to death.
10% of the money you all spend on Reddit awards essentially goes to a Chinese state corporation. But free Hong Kong, right guys?
Watch this get awarded and voted to the top by people so spiteful they choose to celebrate it. $10 says r/politics gets this to the top of r/all within 2 hours.Edit: They pinned it as a megathread. Stay classy.  Feel free to hand out some gold while you're checking in on us.
I'm here for the r/politics awards, please
Why does this have 30 awards? Do these idiots not realize this dude is probably Asymptomatic or has mild symptoms? He'll probably be back in action by early next week.Edit: My bad, this actually has over 100 awards. What the hell is wrongwith people?
At this point I honestly believe that r/politics hacks reddit for giving out awards, how the hell do they have so much money for useless awards?Edit: lord look at the amount of awards in this post... honestly very disappointed.... I thought r/politics would do better.
Prayers for a speedy recovery, as well as no lingering symptoms or permanent damage.
I never understood why it's news when a celebrity or authority figure gets COVID... If they die, let me know...
When a Republican gets the virus, it's their own fault.When a Democrat get the virus, it's Republican's fault, usually specifically Trump.Edit: To the brigaders who are celebrating this news, you represent the absolute worst of our nation's political discourse, and you should honestly be ashamed of yourselves.
Reddit is so toxic, someone gets sick and liberals cheer for him to die. Wtf?
I knew this would get 1,000 awards when I heard the news. r/politics users are sick in the head.Edit: it WORKED KEEP EM COMING BOIS
This is the deep state corruption at work right in front of our eyes. They somehow got a false positive test so it would suppress his efforts to uncover this ridiculous election fraud. /s
Am I late to the r/politics brigade party?
"Now we need him to die." R/politics is a cesspool of disgusting human beings.
Can the brigaders do anything besides waste money on useless awards?
So many awards for this lol
Yes, we're in a pandemic. People are going to get sick. I wish him quick healing.
Three awards in under a half hour, you sick fucks.
Imagine giving Reddit a bunch of money to give pointless awards to posts like this. The politics sub is full of some real loonies.
Imagine if we gloated this way every time someone in r/politics got infected with an STD. Something tells me it would put the number of COVID cases to shame.
The Left always wishes for death the people they don't like. Sounds like a bunch of terrorists
Funnily enough we're talking people who've been going around all the time meeting lots of people, the fact that it took him this long to get it says quite a lot lol.
Imagine giving money to Reddit lmao, cringe.
Guarantee you the ones spending money on those awards complain about their student loan debt and not having money for rent lmao
Covid is serious, we need to save grandma, were all in this together! Unless someone I dont like gets it then its hilarious and I hope they die!
>Feel free to hand out some gold while you're checking in on us.Who gives AF about reddit gold? Stop giving money to China.
Will they give awards when he inevitably beats it?
Definitely. These people are sick in the head.
I consider them badges of honor. Some of the real wackos have PMed me death threats too.
Because Trump's alleged mishandling of the pandemic killed people, so the logic is anyone with an R deserves to die. The same people who preach peace and unity.
Pretending to be women to other neck beards and selling used underwear?
Powermods and admins?It is funny (in a sad sort of way) that left-wingers are less likely to give to charities, but will spend money to celebrate an old man getting sick online.
Regardless of political beliefs everyone should feel this way.
It's news if a celebrity gets it because our media is obsessed with them.It's only news if a right-winger gets it because that news has political utility and can be used to push certain messaging.
When Florida Dems get it, it's DeSantis's fault.  When NY Dems get it, it's Trump's fault.
Leftists were happy when that Republican congressman got shot at the baseball game, and Rand Paul got attacked...remember? They are not nice people. They are dark and lost inside. I pity them as much as I work to combat their destructive behavior.
I think we missed the award train brother :-/
What else would they do with their money besides waste it...studies have shown that conservatives in general are far more generous with their money, give more to charity, and put more in savings...
The mods of that sub actually already pinned it
Can I get some Reddit gold too?Edit: LETS GOOO
Pretty much sums up leftist mentality."Lol haha Rudy got COVID. OMG MOM YOU HAVE IT TOO!?" \*cries\*
You are a MONSTER for propagating COVID! I just hope all republicans and conservatives get it, and, while we're at it, rules for thee and not for me!
this. stop paying money for value-less reddit "awards"
I'm cackling at the reddit hug you got.
The same idiots that care about karma, apparently. It's laughable./u/attic_sardines supports the CCP regime.
You just clearly don't understand tolerance
Please report the DMs to reddit: 
Ive been going back and forth with some leftist troll on the libertarian sub for two days now, its hilarious how unaware of their own ignorance they are
True. Weirdos. Same type of people that would wish our grandparents who die jsut because we aren't liberals. Sick fucks.
>They want people to die You're partially incorrect there, they want people *they dont like* to die
Everybody knows that the more money they throw at reddit, the more likely people you disagree with will die!
True :( meanwhile a family member of mine (who they would hate - he loves Trump, donates to him, and is in the 1% for income the last couple years due to a lifetime of hard work) gives freely to anyone who asks, anyone he sees in need, dozens of charities. Even built a clinic in an underserved community and paid the wages for a doctor for a year. But you know, he is an evil racist white privileged male or whatever, and should pay more in taxes, because the government will totally help all those people more.
Not from /politics, but here you go
Unfair. Plenty of r/politics posters would happily see their mother die if she voted Republican.
Even beyond that, Reddit was laughing at SD governor Kristi Noem because her grandmother died in a nursing home with a COVID problem at the age of 98. The grandmother actually tested negative for COVID, despite the heavily upvoted deliberately misleading titles over in subs like /r/politics.
Personal responsibility and self-reflection. I'm not saying all right wingers have it and all left wingers don't, but there's a definite correlation.
If I had to use context clues to define tolerance from Biden supporters, it would be tolerance - beating people into submission and wishing harm upon those who disagree with you.
Will reddit do anything? Serious question.
Exploiting pain and suffering is the name of the game. Democrats don't actually fix problems; they just exaggerate them to get elected.
>But you know, he is an evil racist white privileged male or whateverYou forgot Fascist and Nazi For real though, your family member sounds like an awesome guy, props to him
> Unfair. Plenty of r/politics posters would happily see their mother die...Nah, even they're not that heartless.> if she voted Republican.Actually, now you right.
Debatable. Quite a few of those posters would then go homeless as a result.
I tend to get DMs somewhat regularly (I'm never aggressive towards anyone, so I don't really know why) and some have been pretty bad. I know at least two users have received permanent bans, so you should be reporting all harassing DMs.You should also report all posts that are being brigaded (like this one).
Because they're narcissistic. Makes them feel all warm and tingly and important inside when they pretend to care.It's pathetic.
Awaken with JP made a rather hilarious and enlightening comparison the other day.  Said the covid vaccine was 94% effective at preventing covid symptoms while covid itself is 80% effective at preventing covid symptoms.
You know what they say, "a fool and his money are soon parted"..Or in the lefts case an "unemployed fool and his parents/unemployment money are soon parted"
I'm not going to spend the next four years how liberals spent the last four - insanely hoping to make the President of the United States illegitimate. I'm not going to like hardly anything the Biden/Harris administration does, and I will surely vote for all of their ideological opponents in 2022 and 2024. However, it only serves to make us look crazy if we act like the left does - let them continue to be the crazy ones.
So my job is as an election official for a large county.  I know how this tuff works. I know how Dominion machines are programmed and what the election code is (for my state). It's frustrating to me because when you know how it works and people who don't have a clue how the process works and come in and say "what the heck is that?? FRAUD!" you try to explain to them "no, a D and an R are both working to recreate ballots that the automated mail opener cut in half by accident. Then they can be fed through the high speed scanner and counted instead of thrown out."  And they say, "FRAUD!"  And you try to explain that this is how we have done this for decades. You explain the checks and double checks, the bipartisan nature or everything that's done. This was the same way we did this in the primary, and the general before that, and the primary before that, when Republicans were in charge and when Democrats were in charge. And it's the same exact thing in the precincts and counties where Trump won." You explain how 95% of the people alleging fraud had 0 training or a half hour orientation before going to the canvassing center.How perfectly normal and mundane procedures can look scary if you've been primed to look for fraud and have not been educated on what is actually happening.But they won't listen to me, even though I'm a registered R.Take the Georgia video for instance.  The only thing about it that would be suspicious is if they told the observers to leave. Both sides say different things on that front.  Poll watchers do not often stay the whole time in my experience and are usually on their phone in recent years.Poll watchers are not required to be present for the process to happen.  The whole thing could (and often does) happen unobserved - for like a century or more.  But they *are* supposed to be allowed in at all times. So if they were told to leave that's not good.  But it's a slap on the wrist offense that probably happens one in a thousand times and has no real bearing or consequence on the election's validity. It's just not a good look.Even in that case, the officials are performing a process that has been 90% overseen and remains on camera and can be verified a thousand different ways in paper and on computers. The only thing they are doing is putting ballots that have already been verified and placed in the designated bins (not suitcases) into a high speed scanner. It's the last 10% of the process, and in and of itself, cannot change any totals. You can look up the batch numbers, reference them to the envelopes, etc. etc. etc.  This is getting ridiculous, but only to save one man's ego.
It's sort of how you know which activities will be deemed essential and which will not...do open churches bring in more tax dollars? Nope, thus not essential. Do open liquor stores and Wal-mart bring in more tax dollars? Yep, clearly essential...
Like South Dakota, Kansa, Wyoming,  Montana, Oklahoma, and Ohio which some of the highest incidence in the nation where the virus is completely out of control, especially given that the populations are much less than the big blue states.
Liquor stores are deemed essential because alcoholics going into withdrawals would put more people into the hospital which is what they want to avoid.
Humble and effective sure, but given how "tolerant" and "respectful" these days seems to be shorthand for "surrenders on all cultural issues" and "bend over and grab your ankles for the press," fuck that.
If you're a republican and you are not on trumps side you have no major future in this party Just a complete lack of awareness that trump is the republican party now His base will do zero for you in 2024, and make no mistake that base isn't going anywhere Guys clueless lol
Can the governor of the state that owns Baltimore claim to be effective?
Trump won't be allowed to run in 2024. Presidents are limited to two terms. :)
Armed protesters shouting threats but no arrests were made?  Sounds fishy to me.
So you disenfranchise voters and expect them to be cool with it, got it
Good. Politicians should be reminded whom they serve.
It's a little strange to see Democrats like Jocelyn Benson and Gretchen Whitmer getting upset over completely peaceful protests when they've been silent about actual attacks on Republicans ever since Maxine Waters issued her call for violence against conservatives years ago.
In my opinion, marching around someone's family home, especially with guns boldly brandished to scare the family, is a bit overkill and unnecessary. Even for a peaceful protest.And no, I'm not against the 2nd amendment.
Obviously protests like this are only okay if, and only if, done by certain groups and to certain people, and NEVER to democrats.
Notice how they're very keen to note the protestors were "armed"?  This is exactly why the 2nd amendment is critical as a power checkThey see people peacefully protesting with nothing but signs.  MehThey see people peacefully protesting \*while having guns\*.  Oh sh\*t.
Maybe if the protestors looted her garage then set her car on fire, *then* itd be peaceful.
Any word on her impeachment btw? Hadn't heard much since I found out that was being pushed.
Some politicians, like Garcetti, have now experienced both BLM and election fraud protests outside their home.
Agreed. Someone's home shouldn't be the target of harassment, even if they are a shitty person.
Well fuck me.  Levin actually makes a really good point.Once again... something almost NO media will tell you.  Republicans approved mail in voting.  Ok no problem because there is a complex series of checks and balances.  Date stamps, signature verification, postmark requirements, deadlines for acceptance and counting.The issue here is that after the Republican legislature approved act 77... Wolf went to the Supreme Court in PA and gutted the protections that were in place and he had no authority to do that and the courts had no authority to grant his requests.This brief sounds solid af tbh.The fact that it was filed with the Supreme Court is also pretty telling.Might I also add that Wolf is one of five Dem governors who used their power to force nursing homes to take Covid patients.  Thereby resulting in a catastrophic death toll from nursing homes in their respective states... which coincidently account for about 40% of total Covid deaths.Strap in boyos.
well then, good news for us, bad news for you. the SCOTUS is taking up the case you guys swore up and down they wouldn't take up (because muh state's rights).
No they're not; it's a hearing on a dismissal. At *most* the SC could reverse the dismissal, at which point it just goes back down to the initial court in which it was filed to play out against an unsympathetic judge and then an unsympathetic state supreme court.
[receipts posted]it's just super funny because you guys were so sure that the SCOTUS wouldn't address it because of the "state's rights" meme. and it doesn't bode well for you because if they agreed with the lower court ruling they would have just let it stand but as we see here they seem *anxious* to get their say. it's almost like your blogs keep you stupid on purpose.nobody is following you, comrade. you're just not that important. see you tomorrow when you come here to make up more lies to cover up today's lies.
Don't hate me because I have a basic understanding of how appeals work, baby girl.
What lies have I shared? I asked you to clarify which court, and which the article gets wrong (God speaking of blogs...)As far as I can tell, SCOTUS is not and has not addressed it. The Supreme Court of PA is (also still "state's rights", whatever you mean by that). And I am willing to bet a few dollars that around 10 AM or so tomorrow, we will see this case dismissed or dismissed with prejudice.And yes, you are following me around, Mr. I say the word blogs a lot.
Powell literally just had her shit pushed in in Georgia. Judge didn't even need a recess after arguments before dismissing the case.
Wait, why would we be coping? Both Pennsylvania and Georgia could flip to Trump and that *still* wouldn't be enough to give him a second term
>tell us, why would they rule on a dismissal if they were intent on letting the lower court ruling stand?You don't understand what's actually before the SC if cert is granted here. It's literally just appealing the dismissal. The SC cannot rule on the case as a whole here without it first going back down to the original court and then making its way back up after losing repeatedly again.It literally doesn't matter what the supreme court thinks about how the original court should rule on anything but the dismissal.
What have *I* been wrong about exactly? If I've been so wrong, surely you must be following me around...Also, aren't you the one coping by arguing that this case (not the dismissal, which is actually what is being heard) will go to SCOTUS?
Bc SC rules on laws, despite what activists think. Their ruling is literally on whether team Trump can amend their claims since a lower court threw them out. Whether the claims could affect the PA election result are not in question, and that's what the SC would have to look at to grant cert if the revised claims made their way up the chain. They're completely different arguments, in both a legal and practical sense.
My guess? They don't want to hear Powell et. al. complain about how the court didn't hear the appeal and let the time run out. So by allowing the dismissal to be appealed before Safe Harbor kicks in, it shuts down any loop holes.As I said earlier, it is to be more fair to that group, no matter how dumb the case is.
Seems like so far they have been right most of the time.
I am a 65 year old man that is beating it now. My strength is coming back and I am feeling better  every day.
I thought there had only been like 4 confirmed cases of re-infection?  Was she one of them?
My dad had a heart attack Friday and was at a large hospital for 40 hours before he got a room because of the covid patients. It's a big problem that may get worse.
Good for her. Surviving the 1918 flu, cancer, and now Covid twice. She sounds like a bad ass.
Too bad about the other 200,000+, oh well, fuck em.
That's exactly right. I have yet to see significant statistical evidence that those who've already been infected can be reinfected and still experience considerable symptoms. As someone who's already had it, I've been on the lookout. You would think that it would be easy to demonstrate if it were true, given the millions of individuals who've already been infected. The original story was that our bodies would be able to effectively fight the virus for the foreseeable future. Until the virus was politicized.
They can never give you an actual rate that it happens to. Most likely because it's not common at all. I mean, come on, if it was that common we would have tons of data.
That happens to some people with the flu or pretty much any respiratory infection. It's not something new with covid. We just didnt care prior to March 2020 and we certainly didnt broadcast it everywhere all day long.
If only we had more social workers available to stop these violent crimes
He's a good person, BLM only riots for criminals.
They can't make money off him since his killers weren't white. They won't make a peep.
He was an actual victim.  Black lies matter doesn't give a shit about him.
Bout fucking time. $5.99/lb for chicken where I'm at. Fucking insane. I mean they should also be doing other stuff. And I'm sure they are. Cuz they have fleets of lawyers
I am so angry I am going to go choke some chickens.
The DOJ cares more about business kickbacks than the integrity of our election smh. Drain the fuckin swamp
I live in Georgia where the plants are. $1.99 / lb down here
The long national nightmare of statistical collusion of chicken is almost over. Our tax dollars at work.
There's a fucking plant 1.2 miles from my house. Tons of chicken farms in NC. And it's insane.
Why not.As long as we're at it.We've gone this far why not?
All homes should be powered by rainbows and unicorns by 2050. Make it law.
I really wish people would take a minute to scroll through the new posts so they could see that their article has already been posted four times before posting it again.
The teachers union does not give a shit about the kids. All they care about is power and money.
How dare those racist and sexist children try to go to school! Shame on them!
Anything to get out of actually teaching
The chicago teachers union will claim the earth is flat if they thought it would get them out of a day of work
There it is!  Making us do our jobs is RAY-SIS!  Fire them all like Reagan fired the Air Traffic Controllers.
Big corporate elites that are deeply connected to the establishment don't like Donald Trump. Shocking.
make sense why they waited until after the election to announce vaccines now?
Pfft. This summit is an attempt at a victory lap for a success he had no involvement in. They're right to snub it.
Why shouldn't everybody snub the POTUS he isn't taking any of it seriously?His Administration refused to sign a contract to purchase 100million doses for the American people and has the US waiting until June to get a chance at orderings anymore.He is the worst President in the history.
I don't think they'll mind so much, however the people around you will.
I for one could not be happier that teachers unions are digging graves for their own profession.
[Same people crying racism over everything be like this on Twitter]
Just cause they deleted it doesn't mean they don't believe it. They were just caught being too socialist right now, that's why it was deleted.
Is not  **Misogyny** also sexism.  Seems like the teachers should learn better vocabulary so they don't make redundant claims in the same sentence.
I'll say it again. We should cut their pay .
Or let them go--like [Reagan did with air traffic controllers].
So what now we live in port o potty?
Im homeschooling my daughter no matter what lol. I refuse to put her in school.
I thought this was the Babylon bee. Nope The SJW infection and destruction of STEM is real
Well, Good luck. Issues need addressed before you can resolve them.
Biden is still not president yet. This could still be overturned...
there's nothing to be overturned, it never turned in the first place
45 days? Is that when the report comes?
Yep.> Section 1. (a) Not later than 45 days after the conclusion of a United States election, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall conduct an assessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election. The assessment shall identify, to the maximum extent ascertainable, the nature of any foreign interference and any methods employed to execute it, the persons involved, and the foreign government or governments that authorized, directed, sponsored, or supported it. The Director of National Intelligence shall deliver this assessment and appropriate supporting information to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.>(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessment and information described in section 1(a) of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate agencies and, as appropriate, State and local officials, shall deliver to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Defense a report evaluating, with respect to the United States election that is the subject of the assessment described in section 1(a):>(i) the extent to which any foreign interference that targeted election infrastructure materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, the tabulation of votes, or the timely transmission of election results; and>(ii) if any foreign interference involved activities targeting the infrastructure of, or pertaining to, a political organization, campaign, or candidate, the extent to which such activities materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, including by unauthorized access to, disclosure or threatened disclosure of, or alteration or falsification of, information or data.
Interesting! Seems that would make the deadline  December 18th
Not a lawyer, but seems like she's (judge) claiming (in 'conclusion') that basically, this wasn't the way to do this.  Oh, and also blatantly ignoring that millions of voters think the election had, at the *very* least, some fraudulent elements that should be investigated.>Plaintiffs ask this Court to ignore the orderly statutory scheme established to challenge elections and to ignore the will of millions of voters.  This, the Court cannot, and will not, do.
Show me a leftist and I'll show you a stupid hypocritical asshole.
Name anything hypocritical you can think of and the person who topped the list of hypocrisy in that subject is somewhere in Biden's projected cabinet.
Strip them of all federal funding, immediately.
I honestly fear CRT will destroy our country.
weird to want to believe you are racist.
I thought his EO only affected the Fed Government.
Just sue them one student or faculty member at a time out of existence.
Yup 100%. We need to defund these racist
That's actually their exact plan.  Using manufactured race outrage to overturn the system.
Yep, but universities get federal aid through the grants and stuff.
We need to get rid of the federal student loan system competely. It's what let's these fancy shithole schools charge over 100k for a bachelor's degree in gender studies or critical race theory. Federal student loans are literally candy for fancy useless colleges.
How is that controversial? Are we not all equal and deserve to be treated as such?
That's gonna start a race war.
It's kind of like the God of the Gaps fallacy. Any discrepancy in data, such as lower African American university attendance, is attributed to America's systemic racism, current racist practices, or the legacy of slavery. Now to some extent that's true. There is a poverty issue, an education issue, and other issues that echo from severe racism in the US. CRT takes it a step further and says the racism is ingrained into institutions *and* people through things like "color blindness" which makes even people who are deliberately not racists out to be racist. The extent to which it goes is way, way too far and buries any solution that might come from exploring race theory. The same issue exists with the feminist theory in sociology. Both of them combine in intersectional theory, which itself points out perceived problems but no solutions.
Everything. Whatever race is in a position of power is automatically racist. So the United States is racist and must be dismantled.....It follows critical theory which is simply whoever is in power is the oppressor.Ironically, whatever would arise from the ashes of the dismantled racist USA will then be the oppressors, but the goal is equality, or now equity that is only obtainable by tearing down others.
Probably saying the students and faculty should sue
CRT had B, F, G and H as core tenets of the faith
Their BLM riots have already started it
No it won't.  Many, many minorities don't believe in tbis BS.  And its pushing them rightward.  Let dems dig their own graves.
I believe the EO effects on condition of receiving federal funds.
I mean, they could forgo federal money and still teach it, but lmao yeah they're gonna line their pockets...
So why hasn't CRT been cancelled for being racist? I mean, I seriously thought people were crazy or joking to actually believe in CRT. People around me find it pretty racist (swing state with a healthy amount of moderates that go either way when voting). Where is it that most people actually agree with CRT?
That doesn't mean their won't be one, it just means it will have more participants.I'm calling it right now, the Dems are gonna start either a race war or a civil war.
Teaching that the government/country is is systemically racist and therefore invalid is not a plot to destroy the government/country?
Academia  "anti-racist" HR trainings and the like  you want to see it fully in action check this out  
I imagine you are not going to respond and you are just going to ride off into the sunset thinking you "owned" everyone.But on the off chance you don't: How many black sons and daughters do you think the police kill each year? (Whether justified or not). I just want to see if you are even in the ball park. I recommend Google, it will help.Then I want to you break that down into justified versus unjustified and we can use the higher estimates for unjustified to make you feel better.Next, I want you to take that number and determine how many were back versus white (as well as other races).Now you will have a number for black people killed by police in the US that was unjustified.I want you to compare that number to the number of Black on Black Murder. I would also like you to compare that to overall gun death numbers. I would also like you to compare that to the number of people who died in this country due to various causes such as heart disease, medical malpractice (weird also a professional making a mistake...), Car crashes, etc.Now that we have some perspective: Let's look at the total US population and against the number above.  I want you to come back with a straight face and say the police are out there just completely out of control murdering black people.  That's fucking bull shit and you know it.The majority of people are not against increased accountability for Police.  They are against riots, they are against defunding the police.  Generally speaking, you will find that, people in America are against being a fucking idiot about this issue, but would also appreciate increased transparency and accountability.Come back when you have a movement promoting that, and promoting solutions to the problems be ways to get there.Otherwise, do everyone in the world a favor and just shut the God damned fuck up and let the adults deal with the world's problems ok?
Would this mean anything for Biden? Any kind of legislation stating a President cannot be sworn in while his family is being investigated for criminal activity?
Your downvotes won't make Hunter and Joe Biden any less corrupt little baby dick brigaders.This is some damning stuff.  Imagine the last name was changed to Trump...
It reads like a movie script
Lmao. Where is this? On what page?Also how can we trust Biden now.. this is centered around him. How can he be sworn into office.
The whole family is a corrupt enterprise and a national security threat.JFC, we thought the Clintons and Obama were corrupt, ha! Rookie numbers.
Mfw when the Dems spent 4 years accusing Trump of literally everything they were doing.
Haven't you noticed that the Media buried the original Hunter Biden stories? They let you see what they want you to believe.
Just do a damn signature audit. All these states and courts refusing to do so tells me that they are hiding something. If everything is on the up and up then they should have no problem running signature audits and doing a full audit on the voting machines ensuring no tampering occurred.
In other breaking news:Water is wet,The sky is blue,Democrats love to spend your money.More news at 5!
Sounds like a great place to make a list
Not as good as Jordan was
Good thing we finally have *professionals*
This ccp cum dumpster needs to move to china once and for all.  What a piece of shit.
and biden is bent on destroying the US fossil fuel industry that WE will all pay more for Energy which is a add cost for EVERYTHING in our economy.
Greta: China is doing great look at their propagandas even fooled me.
You are right about China's impact, and it's true for India too. India and China have such huge populations that if they reach the same per person pollution levels as the US, Canada, and Australia, things will get way worse really fast. I know it sounds bad saying they cannot do what we do.
Because the environmentalism is and always was an excuse for what they actually wanted: social engineering and the centralization of power.
India and China are developing economies and coal is a cheap and easy way to satisfy their need for energy, whereas the U.S has largely moved on to natural gas to satisfy its current energy needs as its both cheaper and better for the environment, hence its drop in production. Alot of U.S coal (varies wildly from state to state) is also quite low quality at a base and is both uncompetitive with natural gas and wouldn't meet environmental standards. For example, West Virginia has vastly majoratively bituminous coal, which isn't the *worst*,  but it just cant compete with anthracite or natural gas, and once you include sulfur content, most companies wouldnt touch it anyway. Of course, coal quality doesn't really matter in India or China, but here in the U.S, its a death sentence. Its hard to tell West Virginians that their coal isnt really valuable anymore, but even if you lifted all the restrictions on it environmentally, the market still wouldn't come back to it. Natural gas is the cause of the death of coal here in the U.S, and its likely to be the mid point between coal and renewables.
They're the 2nd largest (and *the* biggest in some measurements) economy on earth, they're as developed as most other countries.China loves using that excuse probably because they "missed out" on the Imperial age of European powers, probably them trying to sneakily take over small countries. cough cough belt and road.
Not called that - because it was obvious to village idiots that it was NOT happening - renamed the more vague 'climate change' which you can blame everything on  - and even then some leftists say it needs to be called something else because "it doesnt sound threatening enough".
Bullshit.  CO2 is not pollution.  Their per capita numbers are only lower because of poverty.  Not exactly noble.  Go to China, or any SE asian country besides Singapore, and you will see what real pollution is.
Americans with a brain hate China,
No I just want a clean planet
*Only the 3rd nation in the history of the world to have a space program capable of putting a human in orbit and maintain near constant presence in space = 'developing nation'*I always laugh at that description.
The rest of the world is trying to cut back on carbon emissions and move towards renewables while China and India are increasing their use of fossil fuels.
Greta never actually called out or visited China in her world tour, as far as I'm aware. Only western countries. What you're replying to above is a hypothetical.
Neither are growing rapidly, they're both economic powerhouses, not some 2nd world nation.
She 100% has never called out any Asian countries for their greenhouse emissions because she is a political pawn for leftists in the west. The point isn't to cheer for the use of coal (terrible strawman btw), its to be self sufficient until we have the tech to make more efficient and clean energy, which we dont
Greta has never once stepped foot in one of the major leading countries of greenhouse gases. If you can't see how she is a tool for leftists idk what to tell you. They are using a special needs child as a shield to promote their ideology in an attempt to prevent anyone from rebutting her.I agree about nuclear but that isnt talked about with the green new deal nor is gretta talking about it. Wind and solar are not even remotely close to efficient and the mechanisms to create wind energy produce more greenhouse gases than the turbine saves while solar is a byproduct of oil production and wouldn't be possible if we were to stop using oil
$500G? Tf is that? Grams of coke? Jokes aside, I believe you're thinking of Grand, which is an informal use of thousand. You denote thousands as K-Kilo, Kilo = Thousand. $500K, $500M, $500B.
They just throw it in our faces and nothing happens. No one gets punished. Not even a little tiny investigation. But if you look a tiny bit off on your tax forms. AUDIT
Polititians get rich one way or another. That's why the swamp is so deep.
While disgusting there are plenty of republicans who do this same BS. Why do you think they fight so much on stimulus bills for Covid? They are arguing over who gets what pork
I came here to ask when did we collectively make this idiotic switch from K to G. Thank you for expressing my frustration.
Exactly. When people say "the left is so corrupt" or "the right is so corrupt" (talking about whichever side they oppose, of course), my response is always to point out that it's not a problem unique to one party or the other. There are corrupt politicians across the board. There are also good, honest ones out there on both sides.Just another example of why the two-party system is so fucked up. People align with one group and stop paying attention to what's actually going on, it just becomes "us versus them." Partisanship *should* mean "I agree with the values of X group." Instead, it often looks more like "I pledge full, blind loyalty to X group, and I'll always support X candidates. They do no wrong. The other side is full of bad people."And your last point is all too correct. Congress is helping no one with their stalemate over a stimulus package.
Which ones? Perhaps we can get them in the news too! Start shining a light on the cockroaches...
So your perspective on the personal enrichment of Trump enterprises and family members via his presidential vacationing is? I don't like this from Omar. At all. Or Trump. But this is not a one way problem.
More and more people are becoming illiterate, you think it's bad now? Wait till all the kids with ruined educations are 18+.
Look, I'm conservative as they come especially with safety nets. But I'm going to collect social security (because I paid for it and it is the law), and if I ever qualify for other entitlements you better believe I'm going to take them.I vote on my principles and then abide by whatever the system is, and I'm not going to fault someone else for doing the same.I'm aware of corruption claims with Omar. Taking advantage of a government policy that you qualify for is not corruption.
Trump and Kushner did.  Seemed to be a down  the aisle thing in congress too.  Lame stuff.
Jared Kushner is tasked with "bringing peace to the Middle East" along with a thousand other things he's not qualified for, and Trump literally not only has the secret service use his properties, but has raised prices in tandem. Don't act stupid. Family favors and personal enrichment are not some partisan issue. They all do it because it is so very possible.
Guys an asshat, and people are shocked that he's terrible to work for?
I mean he killed thousands in the nursing homes, do people really expect him to be an amazing guy...
What do you expect from the king of NYS, he his our Supreme Leader and he is never wrong s/
Is there any reason the business didn't qualify for it?
So did Trump and Kushner. Tons of businesses connected to politicians did.
Trump and kushner got 3 mil though
*Businesses that lease properties from* Trump and kushner got 3 mil though.Wouldn't want to leave out that crucial part.  Might be deceiving to some people and we wouldn't want that.
If everything goes the way it appears to be the next four years are gonna be hell on earth.
See, there's absolutely no reason to own a gun.
Michigander here.  I don't get it.  I don't understand why Trump didn't win Michigan by a landslide.  Everyone who wants a job can have one here thanks to Trump revitalizing the manufacturing industry.  And that means restaurant jobs, nail salons, and landscapers too since we are all tied to automotive and manufacturing here.  Its fine if you don't like him, but what could you possibly not understand about supporting his presidency ESPECIALLY in a place directly affected by his "BRING BACK AMERICAN JOBS" mentality?
reckon we wont see this in r/politics will we
One word, and I think you already know what it is.
Does it start with an F and rhyme with Maud?
not really my point and im not the one investigating this. do you think an article with a headline like this would make it to r/politics? because i dont
I don't have a "side ", I'm also not insinuating that he did it himself. This just seems like a big leap to assume this was about him being a Trumper.
No one gives a shit about statistics right now... statistical analysis time was week of/after the election. only thing we need/want now is evidence the courts will accept.
Proper statistical analyses don't mean shit to the left because it undermines 99% of their ideology
Honest question. How would the dominion machines change votes if there is a paper ballot that has been verified by the voter?
It seems tons of people on both sides of the political spectrum got massive handouts they didn't need, from politicians to Youtubers who are verified millionaires. We'd have a lot less business owners defying COVID mandates if they could get some actual financial relief. Instead, it's all getting funneled to some of the wealthiest among us.
Why would anyone associated with politics need coronavirus relief funds during this election cycle?
Don't worry. After all the foreclosures, the government will bail out the banks again so only the homeowners lose.
Why did you link to a page that only had a headline, instead of [to the original source]?
i couldnt agree with you more.. we need government for people.. not the swamp
Which of these two sounds more conservative and less faschy:   1. The government picks which businesses and industries succeed and fail.     2. The people get the money and they choose which products to buy and which businesses should be rewarded.   This is conservative 101 guys.
Oh so *now* we're back to fiscal conservatism, huh. Where have you guys been the last 4 years while I've been complaining about the increasingly ridiculous levels of government spending? Why is discretionary spending going up under a "conservative" government? And what's the point of having all branches of the government if you're not willing to do what needs to be done and finally take a look at "mandatory" spending?
Its actually less than a dollar, because it was stolen from citizens via taxes and then redistributed, which requires paying bureacrats. For every 'stimulus' dollar sent out they are likely taking in $3+
Answer two is always the right answer.
How about Economy is fully reopened so people can go back to work
>The government rewards productive peopleLMAO. You can't honestly believe this.The government rewards whoever they want and its usually based on political positioning, optics, or bribing the public for votes.
I think instead of playing this game where we lock down people, arrest them for working, then dole out cash to whomever we think should get it we just go with freedom and let people make their own decisions about weather or not to leave their bubble.
If you want to devalue a currency, this is just about how you do it.
Representing the greatest upward transfer of wealth in the history of the nation.
+Sees chart.+Okay, but that means nothing in and of itself- we also have to ask how much money was taken *out* of circulation within that year.+Sees next chart.+Nevermind, I withdraw my objections. This is a major problem.
So......wait dosent this in a way make rhe value of the dollar go down ?
The comments on the article are pretty interesting.  The gist is that although the money has been injected into the economy none of it is really being spent so the mobility of money is low, which isn't causing inflation due to increased demand (maybe for the PS5).  People don't have anything to spend money on in areas under lockdowns so they are either saving, paying off debt, or investing in the stock market.&#x200B;>**PecuniaNonOlet**Oct 15  >  >Uncle Sam could send me $10k in cash to spend how I want but there is nothing to spend it on.

Buy gold, silver, or Bitcoin before its too late. There's still time.
Who stands to benefit from this? Mega corporations and people who bet against the USD. Side note, George Soros has made lots of money off financial crisis.

Yup.  From a dollar perspective this year looks very much like the biggest bank bailout the world has ever seen.  We're in the midst of share price inflation now as the primaries funnel new dollars into the markets.  Next will come cpi inflation and tax increases which will NOT be accompanied by wage growth as balance sheets are still struggling and jobiden declares amnesty for illegals and re-opens the immigration floodgates.We're back to stagflation and QE to infinity...plan accordingly.
Isn't this very bad? As far as inflation and savings go?I mean, is the *idea* to destroy the financial independence of the middle and lower classes?
So why hasn't the value of the US dollar dropped 23%?
While we're all bickering over useless claims of voter fraud, the current administration embarked on a wildly unproven and likely disastrous economic policy. No sane economist recommended this use of public funds. I eat a fuckton of downvotes when I say this but it won't stop me: this is what we mean when we say Trump is not a conservative. I hope you guys have lots of assets. Stocks and houses will go up with inflation. But your savings accounts are fucked.
As much as the surpluses helped people on the short term, this is the result of artificial stimuli into the economy. I don't care about the downvotes I finna get from saying this, but we shouldn't have shut down. Just should've had social distancing and mask wearing at the most, not shutdown.
I feel rather disheartened by the current trajectory of our nation.So many of us losing everything, unable to go to work, while our billionaires have only gotten richer this year.
A man after my own heart, I thought the exact same thing. I was gonna be all smart and point out our system coped by withdrawing cash from circulation and is working like its supposed to. Oops. No its not. As humourous as I'm trying to be, it concerns me greatly. I got buddies who lived through the fiasco in Argentina. I don't really look forward to finding out my monthly salary now only buys a weeks groceries.
That's why house prices and stock prices are blowing up.It's gonna take some time for inflation to spread throughout the rest of the economy. But eventually people with big stock gains are gonna want to have nice things, and that increased demand will bump up prices of everything.
If there was (theoretically) $10 in the country and the government printed $5 more without actually acquiring more wealth, one of the original dollars is only worth $0.67 compared to what it was worth before (now there are $15 representing the same value as the original $10)
If every day is Halloween and you get candy, eventually candy loses its value. Everyone is so busy eating candy, they can't make it. And you only get empty wrappers now. You could use them as toilet paper though maybe.
I think, more importantly, buy a food storage, weapons and ammo, and a generator.
The man who broke the bank in England.
The velocity of the dollar has decreased substantially
Dropped against what? USD has lost 10% to the Euro while the EU is also printingGold is also up over 10% and bitcoin is at an all time high. USD is dropping against every benchmark
It's the start of their schemes becoming even more blatantly evil.
Yep.  The whole response and overreaction was orchestrated by Chinese propaganda.  Panicking puritanical Americans aided and abetted.
They only ever get richer regardless. Money that big is a self-perpetuating creation. Its not all stacked in some scrooge duck vault , it's in investments and property compounding interest and growing itself. The growth nevers stops sometimes it pivots but keeps on chuggin along.
*That the entirety of Congress voted for but the progressive left ALONE called out for what it was in exact terms before, during, and after, and explicitly stated that they were only voting for it to get people in need whatever they could get to them.
So essentially, shoulda put as much as possible in stocks in March?
To be fair that's basically every modern country with deficit spending. It's a risk to borrow from the future and not spend the money wisely.
Profited tremendously off of the Asian financial crisis too.
I also found that ironic, particularly South Korea. Right now, Moon and the Democrat Party has turned South Korea into a leftist authoritarian craphole with a mask that says democracy, but the only thing they closed were churches because they blamed Christians for spreading covid (when it actually wasn't them but because they allowed people from Wuhan in this cult called Shincheonji, a cult that thinks that the cult founder is the brother of Jesus reincarnated)
Supposedly they are now shutting down because they don't want hospitals to get over run.We all know it's apart of the great reset though. Search World Economic Forum The Great Reset if you don't know what I'm talking about. They need to crash the current system to bring in the new one and this is how they're doing it. Its hard to watch.
I'm loving that the extreme left are pushing a wealth tax here in California.  This will smoke out the rats.
A lot of stocks are still struggling, big tech has basically carried the market to new highs.
Shout-out from Korea! Thanks to no full lockdown, our economy is still doing (comparatively) okay. Businesses are still open. Children are still getting an education (school closings were for a limited time only). The government keeps playing around with ridiculous "levels" of social distancing, issuing and retracting regulations on dining out past 9 pm, having saunas open or closed, etc. And they're heavily restricting religious activities because like you said, Christians have become the ongoing scapegoat for every new outbreak. But overall, it's been much less restrictive than what's been happening in the USA.
The first shutdown was because we were dealing with an unknown entity at the time and so it may have made sense. It was also to buy time. Time for research and time for hospitals to greatly expand capacity. If we require a shutdown now because hospitals are overrun then that is a huge fucking shame on the medical industry. There is absolutely no excuse any more.
328 million people in the US, probably more with illegal immigrants. 300k dead, most of whom were over 65, ain't shit. Not trying to be that guy but everyone know how to take care of themselves at this point, survival of the fittest.
Every millionaire and billionaire does.When the economy goes to shit and people can't pay their mortgages, the 1% are still fine and can snap up cheap property.When the rest of the population is struggling and pulls out their money from the stock market, the 1% are their to snap up billions in stock at rock bottom prices.Basically, the way the average man can get great bargains at a closing down sale, the 1% can do that but with an economy.
Aye, fam that's what I'm talking about.The only reason why the economy is bad over there is because I heard that Moon is taxing the shit outta y'all and his "labor-reforms" has put a lotta people out of business
2.4 to 3 million people die every year in the US. We'll see how much the total number for 2020 is when all is said and done. My guess is it doesn't exceed 3 million.
Yeah, prior to the pandemic a lot of people wore masks here not just when ill, but also because of the terrible pollution. We had a big stockpile of N95s at home for that purpose. These days masks are required on public transit and in buildings that are open to the public like supermarkets, so basically everyone wears them outside the house. Most people wear them outdoors in crowded areas, but not everyone.I actually got yelled at and called crazy by a middle-aged man the other day for not wearing a mask while walking down a deserted sidewalk. But that was unusual, and I suspect I was just an easy target as a foreign woman with a couple babies in tow. My Korean husband doesn't get called out for being mask-free outdoors.Once you venture outside the Seoul metropolitan area, people don't take mask wearing as seriously. When I visited a university in Gangwon Province this past summer, there wasn't a mask in sight. That's probably changed though with the recent uptick in covid cases.
Yeah, taxes have gone up, minimum wage has gone up (which kicked up the prices of food and consumer goods), and Moon's regulations to improve the housing crisis have done nothing but (gasp!) worsen the housing crisis. As in the market price of our newly purchased apartment went up by almost 25% over the course of a month.And the government throws money at welfare benefits like no tomorrow. Our family qualifies for 2 years of free diapers per child, ongoing food assistance, government-owned rental housing (yuck), and super low-interest housing loans - all because my husband's base salary is below a certain amount. Never mind that he earns a lot more through bonuses and freelance projects, and reports income/pays taxes accordingly. They don't look at that. In short, this country is going broke fast.
Aside from general mask-wearing, Korea has a pretty hardcore contact tracing and quarantine system. Most major outbreaks have been in crowded maskless indoor environments (gay clubs, call centers, religious services, etc.).And this is my pet theory, but I think lockdown is so terrible for mental health that it's got to have a detrimental impact on people's immune systems. Whereas Koreans have been able to live fairly normally, getting sun exposure and exercise, getting social support from other people, etc.
We call them "the Biden family" in English.
My question was, apart from the Governor and Speaker who have suggested they would not call a special session, is there any other mechanism that would allow a certain number of legislators to do so?
Typically they need a 3/5 majority to call a special session, but in the case of calling the election into question they only need a simple majority.  One of the senators asks your question in [this video] (timestamp 5:13:44) and gets it explained. He mistakenly says 2/3 but one of the other senators clarifies 3/5 at that point. You can verify that from [this website] that lists each state's Special Session requirements.
Rush is unfortunately correct. The Electoral Colleges vote in just over a week at this point. If Team Trump is going to make its big play, it needs to happen *now*.
Affidavits aren't nothing, but they're not compelling as evidence.  And it's always the seeming nutjobs that come out of the woodwork in circumstances like this.
A lot of bold claims with people screaming they have seen the proof, but we "have to release it the right way."Fuck that.  If you have it, put it all out there.  There should have been online proof after online proof.  Get it all out there.  Snow ball so much proof that the left can't look away.  This whole thing has damaged our republic because many of us no longer believe our votes matter.I'm loyal to the country and conservatism first.  I am grateful for all Trump accomplished against horrible opposition.  He wasn't treated fairly.  But he gave the press so much ammunition. And this farce plays into what the left and press have long said about Trump.  If he lost, then we need to focus on holding the Senate.  Don't get people's hopes up over nothing.  If he won, then put up or shut-up.
This may be the one of the very few times I agree with Rush.
Ultimately, an electoral college win by Mr. Trump's campaign relies on unconstrained state legislators.In my opinion, for them to act in his favor, his campaign needs to first achieve robust success in the courtroom, before neutral arbiters.I don't think his campaign has done that.
Yes we need solid evidence soon
That is what happens when your legal team just play lawyers on tv
No he said, the media's next move would be to portray all Trump supporters who say that this election is stolen as kooks.
Biden won. That is the story.
Seems like this sub is all filled up with bots. Might be time to take a break.
Ware County, Ga has broken the Dominion algorithm: Using sequestered Dominion Equipment, Ware County ran a equal number of Trump votes and Biden votes through the Tabulator and the Tabulator reported a 26% lead for Biden.37 Trump votes used in the equal sample run had been "Switched" from Trump to Biden. In actual algorithmic terms this means that a vote for Trump was counted as 87% of a vote and a vote for Biden was counted as 113% of a vote.Those conducting the test were so shocked that they ran the same ballots again. The same results appeared. ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SOLVED. (It is worth noting that this was one County, and on one Tabulator alone.Dominion Tabulators could have been configured with different algorithms in different Counties or States.) The point is there is now hard evidence of electronic manipulation of the Election.The use of illegal and/or fabricated ballots is an additional issue altogether, but this is sufficient evidence to question the validity of the ENTIRE Election in the 28 states that used Dominion software.

Rush literal said that they would quote this. I'm surprised it took this long to emerge.  I don't the article has the full context. But it's whatever.
This whole things looks entirely clownish.  Powell is a joke, Giuliani is incompetent, and their cases are either terrible or irrelevant.  This reads more like a temper tantrum than anything else.Buckle down, hold Georgia and the Senate, and line up behind Mitch.  Trump's been having his chance, and there is NO chance that we would tolerate it if Biden couldn't prove fraud but he told blue governors of newly red states to just appoint electors anyway.  The sooner the Republican Party realizes that there's way more important shit than Trump, the better.  I didn't vote red to stroke Trump's ego, I voted red to keep my guns, police department funding, and a good economy, as well as to prevent radical left shit.  The second Trump starts interfering with that he should go on the shitlist, and taking a sizable portion of the party with him into Alex Joneshood would *definitely* be interfering with that.
Ignore the brigade. The demoralizing is due to this: 
Luckily there have been orders given to forensically examine voting machines in multiple swing states. This should snowball.
Hence this brigade. This shit is real and it's going to get realer.
While we're on the subject of Georgia, a guy unable to post on this sub told me to share this. Goes into pretty good detail on what we we should be focused on and from what I've seen it's fair enough to debunk red herrings on our side like "suitcases of ballots" and instead focuses on credible allegations of wrongdoing.>This is a 3000 word review of the incident, citing 24 unique, credible sources. All information is based off of mainstream news, government officials, and surveillance footage. There is virtually no speculation contained within the analysis.>TL;DR Enough has been proven in the public sphere to not only show that Fulton County Democrats likely committed extensive election fraud, but also that the GA GOP is attempting to cover up the issue instead of investigating it in good faith. The Georgia Election Fraud incident is several notches above every other accusation of election fraud made so far, and from what I've seen, makes even good faith liberals deeply concerned when they consider the evidence.>Surveillance Footage Composite, P1:  Surveillance Footage Composite, P2:  Infographic, Showing Evidence & Debunking Narrative:  Pastebin with Infographic Sources:  Pastebin with Raw Infographic Text:  This information NEEDS to be organized and disseminated to the public IMMEDIATELY. Governor Kemp, his administration, and Fulton County Democrats need to be held accountable before it is too late.
Wait, so are they saying that we recently ran ballots through the machine (as a test) and discovered the 26% algorithm thing? Or did we forensically analyze the computers and find this evidence?
>Buckle down, hold Georgia and the Senate, and line up behind Mitch.   >... >I didn't vote red to stroke Trump's ego, I voted red to keep my guns, police department funding, and a good economy, as well as to prevent radical left shit.You know what's really miffed me about the GA Republican party recently? I haven't heard them ONCE talk about those issues in any ad. They are playing defense and just blankly calling ossof and Warnock as crazy, without mentioning it. WHY?!? it would motivate people!
I'm more worried that the true believers are just going to blackball Rush now the same way they turned on Fox.
> Powell is a joke, Giuliani is incompetentDon't forget Lunatic Lin Wood taking a break from his own terrible cases and Q conspiracy ramblings to try and throw both Senate run-offs in GA and give the Dems control of the Senate.
> This is an accumulation of facts not theories or opinionsAre these facts, or are they "facts" shown to you *exclusively* by people who very explicitly want Trump to remain president? I think a great example is the dead voter thing, where lots of those people have either [turned out to be alive and well], or they were misrepresented in that number because they shared a name with a dead person.  Or how Trump's legal team lodged a complaint about how they weren't allowed to observe the process, but when they got in front of the judge and under oath they had to admit that there were Trump poll watchers in the room so the case got thrown out. Or any of the other 40+ lawsuits that got thrown out, frequently by Republican judges and judges Trump himself appointed, with prejudice, for having no backing. If the only places you get your facts from are incredibly biased sources who are clearly pushing a narrative, then it is inevitable that many of the "facts" you believe aren't facts at all.
Elaborate please. If Trump truly is making a comeback I want to know, but I refuse to believe it without evidence.
So I thought Rush was a big voice on the right. I pretty much stopped listening to him years ago .mostly to manage my own blood pressure. But he always seemed right to me. What is with the down votes.
What are you going to trust? The hand recount that got the same result and would've easily caught cheating like this? Or the 6 pixels in this video, where much of it is obscured by the person having their back to us, and where it's nearly impossible to tell what's going on without labels and captions added by someone who clearly and explicitly wants you to see malfeasance?
That would make a lot of sense if we had two years to get a result. We have two weeks.
If you get a jam you're supposed to run the whole batch again. Question is whether she cleared the count each time she re-ran the jammed ballots through.
Or this  this
GA is playing to lose in the classic pre-Trump fashion... they believe in traditional means and that's infuriating the Trump set which has seen the traditional way as a path to abject failure.  So in the end the GA Republicans are basically playing Nero.
I don't think Rush cares at this point.  His audience is loyal to him.  And he has stage 4 lung cancer.
Ben Shapiro had comments for his recent episodes where people were bashing him for...  wait for it... asking for evidence.  Also, seeing people attack Tucker for impurity was hilarious, particularly since he's big enough to not take as much of a hit as others (and Trump praised both him and Ingram at his Georgia rally so heads must have exploded).Pro-tip for any of those reading:  if you're attacking people who have done far more for modern conservatism than Donald Trump because they're not falling in line and endorsing whatever the leader says, you're not a conservative, you have no serious political identity that falls anywhere near conservatism beyond supporting Trump.
That is exactly what's going to happen. The true believers are going to cling to this stuff for a longgg time and I think the GOP is in for a big internal struggle between hardcore Trump Republicans and the rest of the Republicans that have moved on
Well in all fairness, Fox is shit
Of course they will.  He's expressed less than 105% support for dear leader.  They'll now promptly vote him off the island.  Fortunately for him he likely doesn't care.
Fox earned it, IMO.  But Rush is right.  The clownshow ops are not helping. I would point people to Viva and Barnes.  They run a Sunday podcast on Youtube but also setup on Locals as a mental hive but I think as a way to get Viva Frei (David Freiheit, montreal lawyer who has gone YT full time) some income and for Robert Barnes (Las Vegas based high profile civil rights lawyer) an interlocutor for his thoughts and for legal/political organization.  Their Locals portal costs 5 dollars/mo. but they're the basis for a fair number of lawsuits in AZ and GA and I think looks to be a solid legal portal to start the fight back and the fightback writ large against the corruption state.Back to rush.  He's right.  We have short time and very real issues that don't look like a Tom Clancy novel and a cloud of dust.  Challenge the signature matches, they screwed with the threshold rules in all those states outside of the law.  Equal protection is the other important angle.  In fact equal protection is the most important way.The fight back needs to occur, people.  But we need to operate on clear evidence that can be brought and blatant facts.  Make it BLATANTLY clear.
It'll be a fun two years between now and 2022, but yeah, here's hoping.  Joe Manchin has calmed my nerves a *little* bit, he's the Democrat in the Senate that I like, but it's still a distinct possibility that we experience some shit if the Republicans can't hold the Senate.  If we can get through the next two years and then expand our position in the House, we can stop the more destructive Democrat policies.This all involves a lot of gridlock of course, but honestly, with how divided the country is, that's probably better than the alternative.
The sub has been overrun with r/politics trolls.
wtf twitter "This claim" isn't even a claim. It's an embedded video with a comment that says "Hey, what's this?"
I've heavily thought about getting involved in the machine of the GA GOP but I have a BIG feeling any change to actually do something is a huge uphill battle.
The GA Republican candidates are reminding me of McSally.  Thankfully, they don't have her problem of running against a formidable opponent in John McCain's state when Trump was on the ballot, but it's still an idiot's game either way.  I heard somewhere that Democrats tend to like the Democrat Party more than Republicans like the Republican Party, and I absolutely believe it.
Trump fanatics (not supporters or voter) are acting just like leftists act. Attacking people for having the "wrong" opinion, wanting to cancel people, destroy reputations and so on. I could not believe how they turned against Tucker. It's disgusting imo.
> However, if his lawyer has a list of 10k dead people (which is half the number BTW needed to flip Wisconsin) I would like to know for sure that list is completely false instead of explaning it away in my head for my comfort if I were a Biden suppporter.I would like to know that at least a non-trivial amount of that list of 10k was verifiably true before I accept it on its face. It's literally 10,000 people. If the list was legit, it shouldn't be that difficult for Guiliani or someone else on Trump's team to pick out like 50 and provide bonafide, irrefutable, proof that this *specific* person is dead and that they cast a ballot in the election. As it stands [multiple] news networks picked out a sample from the list and proved that the overwhelming majority of the sample was horseshit, because the people on the list either weren't dead or didn't vote. It is impractical to check all 10,000 claims of dead voters, but if the people making the claim can't back up even a small sample with bonafide proof then you shouldn't accept it as true. I could pull up a list of 15 million names right now and tell you that they're all dead and they all voted in the election, but you shouldn't believe me unless I prove at least some of those names are true. You shouldn't expect someone to prove that all of the names are false before you disbelieve me. *I'm* making the claim, so *I* have the burden of proof.> However, I watched the hearings. Unlike the news media, these people will go to jail if they're caught lying.That's actually not true and, for the most part, the people in the hearings were not under oath. Even that lady who proudly said that she "signed a paper that says if she's wrong she goes to jail" wasn't under oath during her hearing. She submitted a signed affidavit that put her under penalty of perjury for more vague claims, but the specific and damning claims she was making during the hearing were not under oath.
That video was shit you're getting downvoted by everybody not just liberals lol
Really, it's Jan 4 when the electoral votes are counted by the House.But after that, there's not really a remedy for anything.
>Izzere a statute of limitations regarding felony fraud we don't know about, but you do? Enlighten us please.If the goal is to prosecute those who have defrauded an election, then there's little to worry about time-wise.If their goal is to ensure an election has the legitimate victor, then there is a time crunch. Dec 8th is when the Constitution states all election controversies must be settled, otherwise known as Safe Harbor Day.All states are required via the Constitution to certify by Dec 14th, IIRC. The process to de-certify after this date isn't legally established, meaning it's never been contested like we're likely about to see.Also, once the winner is inaugurated, you can't just un-inaugurate him. The process then follows the impeachment process and subsequent chains of authority kick in.IOW, you can't just kick Biden out and install Trump *after* inauguration day. So yeah, this a time sensitive matter.
Oh the irony of getting angry that a business owner decided how and who they want to serve in their own restaurant. Hypocrisy much?
Being a hypocrite is almost always worse than anything else. If you wanna be an idiot fine, but at least be consistently stupid.
Holy shit he said something I actually agree with
I pointed this out over on r/trashy and the army that is Reddit downvoted me to oblivion and tried to run me off lmao. I was surprised though by how many came to my defense as well though.
You know it's really bad when Trevor starts giving real news.
Pretty much all my neighbors are left wing democrats with Biden signs on their lawns.  And they still have parties and large gatherings all the time.  And they always complain to me that trump is mishandling the pandemic.  Look in the fucking mirror assholes. hypocrisy is the one unforgivable sin in my book
It is so much more damaging because it shows bad leadership.
I've lost a lot of respect for this man this year, but I gotta admit I appreciate him for making this statement.
I love how the article called this guy a comedian
THANK YOU! Now that Trump is on his way out, the Trump Derangement Syndrome is wearing off.
Broken clock yadayadayada. Dude still can't tell a decent joke. I'm not going to start pretending I care about Trevor Noah's opinion just because I agree with it.
Trevor Noah is foreign election interference personified.
something something, broken clock right twice a day, something something.....
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Fuck him.
Trevor Noah is so not funny. Everytime I see him on TV I just cringe at how stupid he sounds. I hate that guy. How is he even on a comedy show?
can we take a moment to realize how Awful of a daily shot host Trevor Noah was. Back in my liberal days a few years ago I liked him even better than Jon Stewart but now looking back I realize how good Jon Stewart was and how much of a downgrade Trevor is
The number 1 lesson from the sight of all these government officials cheating on their lockdowns is not that the officials are hypocrites. The lesson is that they don't believe their own Wuhan virus hysteria. If they did, they would not risk their own lives and their lives of their children just for trips to Cabo or meals at fancy restaurants.
Holy shit, Trevor Noah actually said something smart?
Grab the popcorn, the left is eating itself
IF you think this is the only hypocritical things that Democrats have been busted doing this week/month/year/decade/entire existence of party then you really are wearing blinders.
Not a conservative but I 100% agree. It just sows doubt in the legitimacy of these measures. Like that video of a restaurant owner shut down but had Hollywood dining outside in their parking lot. If we are going to have these measures to prevent spread leaders must not only lead by example but support those that are effected financially.
Exactly.  But the problem is that we vote for politicians instead of statesmen/women.  We need leaders and we get political beings.
Agreed! If anything hypocrisy like that encourages others to take it even further.
I was talking about this on my states sub. Of course it's full of liberals and Democrats and some jackass actually told me, "well at least the Democrats are saying the right things". That sub is putting the sole blame on Republicans and Conservatives. I told them if out elected officials can't lead by example then what do the expect?
Hypocrites are also worse because they prey on the stupid.
It's absolutely worse. Once "experts" and people in charge lose the public's trust, it does not fully come back. Combined with "rules for thee and not for me" being on full public display and I'm surprised these leaders don't have a full on revolt in some of these municipalities and states.
No Norm Macdonald fans here? Ok :(
Totally agree.  Consistently bad or consistently good, but inconsistency is the hardest to deal with.  Humans or troubleshooting problems!
So hypocrisy is bad. We agree. How about conservatives hold their own to that standard? Lindsay gram anybody? The trump anyone? All bigger hypocrites than this.Edit: sorry i can't get over this, how are you both against hypocrisy and for the conservatives?? The conservatives have proven time and time again they are pro hypocrisy. The real answer is both sides do things that are frustrating and hypocritical. One side is way worse than the other, and if you can't see that you're not looking.
Same.  I feel a little dirty for it too.
r/trashy is basically r/politics with no cited sources. Cesspool.
Bro, it's a fucking disgrace. I'm a Democrat and I feel like my opinions are less downvoted and censored on here than on r/Politics. Guess I'm just too moderate for Reddit.
I saw that, and I gave you my upvote for what it was worth. Though you were already deep in the negative by that point.I also eyeroll a lot when it's just "look at this person with a Maga hat", luckily I think a lot of people got sick of those posts so they stopped being as regular.
I still get screeched at when I point out that the medical community told us not to wear masks because they are ineffective.  Probably by the same people who told me I was anti-science last spring when I said I was wearing one and everyone should, too.
Actually now that trump has lost and they got their president, they'll start speaking more sensibly so as not to alienate their relatively centrist supporters. Don't know if I said it correctly, not good at grammar.
Out of a staff of 10 employees, I have four co-workers that are outspoken liberals. I've heard three of the four use the n word multiple times and also spew racist anecdotes from time to time. But if politics comes up then they will rear their heads to unironically preach about black lives matter, republicans are racist and uneducated, etc etc. Yet *they* are literally some of the most racist and uneducated people I've known. The hypocrisy of some leftists is truly mind boggling sometimes. I can't fathom having so little self awareness
They lost their minds when Trump won
Its sad because when he's not talking about politics Trevor Noah is honestly sorta funny. However every time I hear him on comedy central I cringe
It's ok to call out Dems a *little bit* now that Biden is set to win.
2020 is bringing crazy shit, like me agreeing with Noah.
As a south african born. Can confirm he's a biased racist who supports racial genocide in South Africa by dehumanising white South Africans. He also lies about apartheid but that was before my time so I don't really care as much about that.
He has released multiple successful comedy specials. Whether or not you like his comedy, he is a comedian.
90% of his stuff is "orange man bad" but the other 10% is usually funny. He just went the way of Kimmel and former funny people.
I don't know about that. Even with Trump out of the White House, the left will be forever vigilant against 'Trumpism' (read: anyone who balks at identity politics and socialism).
The man hasn't conceded and the vast majority of Republicans haven't publicly recognized the biden administration. TDS is a response to Trump saying and doing dumb shit and I don't see either stopping any time soon.
I have no idea how he has a show.  Worse than that is people use his show for a source of news and retweet his tweets as of they are some deep thought wisdom.His show is not news, not funny, and about as shallow as a mud puddle.
Is it really risking your life if you have better access to healthcare than 98% of americans, and I dont mean insurance.  Please, let's call it what it is, they dont care. Just because they dont give a shit about you doesnt make it fake. I implore you, reconsider your stance, be better than them
It's less about supporting him and more of the fact that someone on the left actually acknowledged the hypocrisy going on. It doesn't matter, in this case, who said it.
Everyone on the left agreed with what he said lmao
So is the right with a small percentage wanting to boycott the Senate runoffs since Perdue's been AWOL and hasn't tried to defend Trump in his lawsuits. It's a total mess. I doubt any side gives a shit about you or me. They just wanna make the other side look bad and it's entertaining as all hell to watch.
we been doing it all along The two, by far largest factions on the left are progressives (younger and lean toward social democracy ala M4A) and moderates dems who actually like Biden because he's pleasant and cautious.  Then you have a genuinely tiny number of actual leftists (ie socialists / marxists) who only seem to care about the long game, and your angry radicals.  We're constantly battling.But in this case, we are in agreement that dems who put in strong measures (that we mostly understand and agree with), and then completely flaunt them, completely suck.
The left will criticize our leaders when they're wrong. Unlike the right, who would never "eat themselves"
Like pelosi proudly saying that witholding stimulus was her choice
I'm a Democrat and I love him even more for saying that. Our establishment's full of shit. Why the hell do they care about dumb shit like legalizing weed amidst a huge recession? They need to get their priorities set straight.
I was trying to explain this to someone over at r/libertarian and was getting downvoted. If you are going to set policy to shut down people's livelihood in the interest of public safety, then go eat in a restaurant before the order sets in, you are setting the example that your policy is either bullshit, or at the very least, that you don't believe in why you're setting it. I'm not conservative either, but I'd expect the Democrats, after trying to sell the whole "party against corruption" narrative to not blatantly act hypocritical or corrupt.
Just remember it is easier to get rich when everyone else is poor.
So our leader should have set an example. Got it.
\> *We vote for politicians instead of statesmen/women.  We need leaders and we get political beings.*If that's to ever happen then we need to get rid of campaign contributions and let the best ideas win. The amount of money you raise shouldn't dictate your odds of representing the people.
Gotcha politics has been around forever.
I'm a progressive liberal Democrat and I agree with you. Most sane Democrats agree, even on the politics sub. Officials who tout the need to stay home for the holidays due to the pandemic but travel themselves because they consider themselves exempt or above the rest of us are scum, regardless of party. Full stop.>I told them if out elected officials can't lead by example then what do the expect?I wish Trump had done so. I would have actually given him credit if he didn't frequently spurn the advice of his own task force.
Hiding was the worst thing she could have done.  Its 100% admittance of guilt.
Wow if she really hid that's super dumb. But you can't blame people for using planes while talking about climate change. The point is to make travel, etc. more climate friendly but you can't exactly just stop using our current facilities in the meantime, especially when you're a politician. But you can ride planes while advocating for them to be closer to carbon neutral. Also, the GND isn't even a law, it's a resolution which just defines a set of goals like reducing emissions. People bitch and moan about the GND all the time but if they actually took the 2 seconds to read the super short ass pdf of it instead of parroting whatever their favorite conservative commentator says then they'd know that.
Or flying on private jets to your yacht, like Biden's new climate czar.
Those beach front properties have government-subsidized flood insurance as it would be prohibitively expensive otherwise. The wealthy get welfare for their additional, unoccupied homes. Both party seats are filled the the obscenely wealthy who understand the grift that is government.
You'll know it's really serious when insurance companies stop writing policies for beach front property.
I'm not sure how religious people on this sub are, but from my view as someone who isn't very religious, this is how I view megachurches. So many of the head pastors simply use the money they make to fund themselves, and some even admit it. Wilbur Glenn Voliva even admitted he had used church funds for personal purposes before his death in the 1940s. Today, people like Kenneth Copeland are making millions and using it to buy another private jet, based on the donations made by his followers in good faith.
It helps that the public carries water for their policies that the leaders have displayed they don't personally care about.
You're living in a bit of a vacuum if you don't think the conservative side of the aisle has an insane amount of hypocrisy to deal with as well. Which is why Democrats DO have a field day with it. They just ignore their own hypocrisy ...much like you are ignoring yours.
I mean at least Conan's pretty tame most times, at least compared to others. He's the only one I still watch nowadays
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Conan no matter where you are on the political spectrum.
I get thrown out of r/politics every week for asking legitimate realistic questions
r/politics really hates moderates... it's really bizarre. I might disagree with moderates on things depending on the topic, but most of the population is fairly moderate. In my experience moderates are just people who aren't unhealthily interested in politics and actually have other interests (I make no excuse for myself, I literally majored in PoliSci and I definitely would classify politics as one of my biggest hobbies for the amount of time I spend on it).
As long as you're using your brain and can see the bullshit that's been going on lately, I don't care if you're Democrat, Liberal, what have you. All I want are open eyes.
Yeah I like some marxist ideas, but I am too moderate for r/politics on many issues. I also like free markets and some milton friedman ideas...so still conservative!The median voter is white, around 50, and doesn't have a college degree. Reddit is not like that. It's a problem from Dems because young activists on teh internets are shaping what issues dem candidates talk about and how they are talked about, which alienates a lot of folks, even black people who tend to be more conservative than white liberals.Mathew Yglesias and David Shor talk about this alot. When I post in r/politics points like this, it doesn't end well. .That is why I look at politics on twitter. Actual journalists, analysis, and academics post. I recommend following the two people I mentioned on twitter.David Shor is doing a lot of podcasts now, so I would recommend looking one up. Yausha Mounk (NYT /Atlantic) did one and the  neoliberal podcast (very moderate dem) did one. They are good!
I vote based on candidates instead of on parties and I currently align with the Democrats. I expressed this and someone in politics asked me why I could ever have voted for any other party. I gave an honest answer with sources and was downvoted to oblivion. The only replies I got were just hateful rhetoric. I wonder if they realize that doesn't scare people into voting with them. It pushes people away from their policies and politicians.
The angry mob is strong with that sub, for sure. I dipped a little toe in once and noped the hell out of there quick!
What shocked me was getting two golds and a silver with a hugely downvoted post. Thanks for the upvote lmao.
> They lost their minds when Trump wonYep, all of the late-night show hosts lost their minds simultaneously. What were the odds?
Gotta keep that image of impartiality.
So, in what feels like another life now I lived in China and worked with tons of South Africans.I had never in my life met someone who so calmly and (in their mind) justifiably discuss why it is okay to  exclude someone for their skin color until after a night with some black South African colleagues and a few hours of free flow beer.Hateful racism is awful for obvious reasons, but this sort of calm and "logical" racism is so much scarier in my mind.
If tried watching him plenty of times and never even breathed heavily out of my nose (like what you do when you type LOL) hes more obnoxious than funny
No he's just a foreign "personality", artificially astroturfed despite his obvious lack of talent to receive millions of views weekly, while commenting on a country he wasn't born in and didn't take the time to understand. And given the fact that the previous "election interference" was literally Facebook ads, I'd say Trevor Noah is a significantly more malignant foreign influence than that joke.
Ugh I miss that sub being good. Place devoted to people who should love liberty and they love to support the lockdowns.
I'd bet they down voted you because libertarians don't believe a government should have the power to create a lockdown. The way our leaders are handing this is the exact reason why libertarians don't think government (our 'leaders') should have that kind of power...
That sib is mostly a leftist larping sub now. Checkout blackandgold for a good Libertarian sub.
Only the privileged and wealthy can live their lives.
I wish people would stop using the rhetoric of "your people." It's just a way to demonize your fellow American. 3000 Americans are dying every day. Not liberals, not conservatives, Americans.
It's difficult to make of-the-moment analysis from what data we have available, but despite the proven partial efficacy of masks in reducing the spread, the overall numbers in states with high mask compliance and widespread mandates aren't generally better than states with more choice. I split my time between NJ and GA, which might as well be on different planets regarding Covid, and the numbers won't show you anything useful between them other than the negative effects of density - which can't be overcome with masking, demonstrated by the rising numbers. Yet again.
I think that's why he lost the election due to the overall handling of this pandemic.  Making fun of Joe Biden during the debate about wearing a mask and railing against others for doing the same was a mistake.  His big mouth lost him this election.  I voted for him.  I'll probably get downvoted for this comment but oh well.
That sounds really good on the face of it.  What are the arguments on not having term limits?
Not in the way it has been the last few years.  Everybody has a video camera in their pocket and information can reach people across the world in seconds.
And yet they still vote her in, SMH,
You think she was hiding from a camera, because she wanted people to believe she doesn't use planes?  Surely you're joking.
I've read it and it talks about very extreme measures. If it actually cared about combating climate change there would be a big, massive component of it that talked about nuclear, as its the only source that can supply our growing energy needs at anywhere near affordable.It's not a serious provision, and there's a lot in it that doesn't make sense. No, it's not conservative fear mongering. It's nutty dreaming from people who don't understand economics or 2nd order consequences.
Paper mills have long since planted more trees than they cut down. Also a lot of work has been done to use sustainable paper that meet SFI and FSC certifications.
That has already happened in North Carolina. We have a 13 county region that does not have any private Wind and Hail insurance coverage.  The state had to step in and provide a "state run" Wind and Hail insurance program for the counties.  our concern is that when the next hurricane hits, will there be enough funds to cover the damages.Funny thing is frequently more damage occurs inland from hurricanes then on the coast, where homes are built to meet +120mph winds.
98% of the scientists DON'T support "consensus".  Seriously, do a bit of digging into the consensus numbers... they are much weaker than you probably think.  (The studies that claim >95% numbers mischaracterize studies, have shoddy statistics, include climate activists and psychologists as "scientists", and conflate agreement on a few uncontested points with agreement on all aspects of the climate-agenda.  The manufacturing of the high consensus numbers has actually been VERY well studied.  Of course, as a scientist myself, I know that Science is  *never* actually settled.
What are EV going to run off of, unicorne semen?  There's over 60 countries planning or erecting over 160 coal burning plants right now.  Did I take acid in Jan of 2020 and it hasn't worn off yet?
Not religious either but watching Copeland makes me believe in demons
Joel Olsteen is the absolute worst when it comes to this
As an active Christian, I hate those people. Corrupting the Bible and suckering people to get rich is evil. Jesus saw people doing it back in the day and beat the hell out of them. Not saying a church can't be big. Not saying a pastor must be poor. But those people are trash
This is how many religious people view megachurches too. Unfortunately, not enough though.
I agree, this definitely isn't mutually exclusive to any one group.
Just please know that while there are definitely hypocritical religious leaders like this, there are many, many good ones. We are none of us perfect, of course. Some are more not perfect than others.
I know it's a cliche talking point these days but I really don't think that the poisonous well that mainstream media and big tech is can be pointed out enough. The entire narrative and talking points are driven by what a very small and select group of people decide. We do not have a free and fair media in this country.
Also /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump, plenty of examples right from the horses mouth.
Well you'll enjoy Colbert much more in the coming years then because he has already started to make fun of Biden.
Colbert was ripping on Biden before he was even nominated Democratic candidate. He's ripping on him more now.  Biden is an easier target than someone like Kamala for him
Liberal IS the moderate left. The far left is socialists and communists.
Your last "realistic question" there was saying "oh, you discriminate? What if he was Muslim?"To someone who said they passed on a  job candidate who belittled women and had a Trump flag in the background during their Zoom interviewTheir scenario was clearly fake, but you used it as the chance to say he wasn't hired because of the flag and you know this because they'd have hired a Muslim who belittled women because all Muslims belittle women (?)
I've gotten kicked off 3-4 subreddits for saying bad things about BLM.  That is a huge liberal no-no.  BLM is like the Little Sisters of the Poor to liberals.
I'm the bigot, brain-washed, non-empathetic trumptard but they are the ones getting themselves gaslit by tons of opinion-piece posts masqaurading as prominent news that last few years over there.  That echo-chamber is as about as real as it gets and dissension is attacked with raid.
Its like you're even worse for not somehow recognizing the evil right and not knowing the right thing to do of joining the righteous left
My pet theory is that the sub (among many others) has been co-opted by foreign interests seeking to radicalize and dumb down the American electorate over the long-term.
I posted the link of pa house asking congress to throw out their electors and got 3 day banned.
That never happened on the Daily Show even at its best times under Jon Stewart. He would occasionally criticize the left, but there was never even anything approaching equal swings.My favorite times from that era was on the Colbert Report right after Daily Show, when Colbert would do interviews in his pseudo conservative character, and debate the interviewee, and accidentally win the argument while trying to be a parody of a conservative.
hey if they wanna go back to Apartheid, that's their choice, but I don't think they'll like the results.
I knew a white guy from south africa. Hated trevor, he said he was one of the most hypocritical asshats around. Apparently when he was there he supported alot of conservative positions then flipped when he came over here for the fame. Said not to trust a damn thing that came out of his mouth since it was all for show.
South African here, racism against whites is definitely prevelant. However, Trevor Noah was not a racist before he left. In fact, everyone this side regarded him in the highest esteem. Then he took on the Daily Show, sold out, and became a leftist shill who parrots racist narratives. It's a real shame.
Yeah you can tell he's ultra racist and is basically the equivalent of a deep south hick but for the other team. He probably says things like "...all white people" and whispers under his breath when around white people too.You know, the same way white racists are. Huh, imagine that. It's almost like racism can go both ways? Wild right.
I'm simply pointing that it's dumb as shit to question the integrity of an election with no evidence and people will continue to point that out as long he's doing and saying dumb shit. It's not really deranged to be against someone trying to undermine our democracy.
Look at the comment he's replying to. You can start the healing too
Literally all of these complaints originated on the left. You could easily find articles on all of those subjects from the primaries.   The vast majority of the right won't even accept the results in Georgia even with a full, hand audited recount.
I mean those are all things she got torn apart for during the primaries, so...
Lol as a leftist even i would have to agree with u both the parties are pretty damn shady.
"Libertarian" is a pretty wide net though, but I get your point. I wasn't even advocating for a lockdown though, just trying to say if you're gonna push policy, then you should act as though you actually believe in the policy you're pushing by abiding by said policy. Not like many govt officials and legislators abide by the rules they set for us anyways though, so naivite on my part I guess.
Don't get me wrong, I'm more on the left leaning side of the libertarian spectrum, but a sub advocating more for voting Biden than your own candidate just comes off a bit disingenuous.
I think they are doing the typical passive aggressive comment about Trump.
The lifers would be out of their job
That's the problem with statistics. It can be very difficult to get an unbiased set of statistics, especially if the bias is unintentional, but people just believe them.
Can I inquire what field of science you are in? Despite myself being an extremely progressive scientist, it's so refreshing to see people with views on the other side of issues that actually are able to discuss topics rationally. Isn't it incredibly frustrating how the general public has no idea how science actually works, and scientists changing their positions on things based on new information is seen as a failing of science instead of how it should work?
Can I have a source for this? I just cant find anything that corroborates what you're saying, only a plethora of sources that claim the opposite.
Wind and solar will power the future! So yeah, unicorn spunk. Nuclear would be good answer but they hate that. If. I call bullshit.
Solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear are all increasingly viable options.
Him and McConnell, America's greatest demonic forces. They look like evil monsters from the movies
Joel Osteen is a raging pile of shit.
The Colbert report was great, dunno what happened in the new show to make it suck this much.
Just doing his duty as a media man - bash the guy in charge at all costs.
Is that why it has posts shitting on China all the time? Makes sense.
CCP pushed by CNN, the Communist News Network
\*sub regular states a common partisan talking point/belief\*person who's not sure of their view: Well, I've heard the opposite, do you have a source for that?  \*gets told to do their own research or that they're brainwashed\*
Has the daily show ever had a conservative audience?
White South a fricans are being sytematically marginalized, killed or driven off. I don't think they have the power to even protect themselves.
As a white former south african. He is the most untrustworthy person on US tv, and that's saying a lot.
I'm a deep South hick, so waych it.
Right and those accusations were proven to be without merit over the course of a 2 and a half year investigation. If the democrats had even the most milquetoast sense of integrity,  they would have never mentioned foreign interference again. Non Americans having opinions I don't like isn't the problem. Foreigners who don't have even the faintest idea of our country or how it works getting millions of views because they're artificially astroturfed by multinational corporations IS election interference when they're commentating on the election. Pretty simple stuff to understand.
BULLSHITstop posting lies just because they make you feel good.Seriously,  how can they not work, how can you think coughing with no mask is the same as coughing with a mask? and let me reiterate as loudly as possible,  being a fucking idiot and not wearing a mask is in no way a conservative value.
Now this I agree with. I'm pretty libertarian but if you make a policy...you better live by that crap or youre a hypocrite and I no longer care what policy you pushed.It's now meaningless to me...
I'd say he hit the nail on the head.
Bandanas are effective in stopping covid?  based on what scientific study?
It also adds to the power of the political parties. The parties are already machines that locate potential candidates, drive legislation, and control funds for just about everything a candidate needs. Term limits like you point out make for greener experienced officeholders, which will push back against the parties a lot less than say a Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, or anyone else with the long time political capital needed to hold their ground against their party turning on them Not to mention term limits doesn't necessarily make for politicians going away, a Diane Feinstein might not be a Senator anymore, but what about member of the house? Your going to see the career politicians simply move everytime they hit the term limit in a certain position, not leave politics all together. Which really is not better, I'd rather have someone be a senator for 18 years than them be a senator for 6, member of the house for 4, a cabinet member for 4, and then a state legislature for 4.
Counter thought to that, is having no term limits allows the lobbyists time to buddy up to congressmen/women. If they only have a limited amount of time, there could be congressmen/women that can hold out on giving in to them.
[Over 60 countries planning or under construction]. Mostly in China and Africa but other western countries like Australia are in there, too. MW?  The article I posted says hundreds of GW are planned.  Not sure about natural gas, but the US isn't planning any new plants b/c we have the cleanest coal resource ( **Bituminous** ) in the world mixed with technologically efficient burning of it.
They're all prohibitively expensive and not scalable, as long as the Left won't seriously consider nuclear power. Wishful thinking is not the same as strategic planning. Unfortunately.
Candace Owens is very clear on her change from left side of the aisle to right. She has talked about it many times and wrote about it in her book.
Ooh, sick burn bruh. Was that one on your script or did you come up with that completely on your own?
Well, off the top of my head, there was an incident a few years back where police officers were confronted by violent rioters and they opened fire, killing some rioters (Google "marikana massacre", there's a Wikipedia page, but it's heavily biased), and in one of his specials he took the side of the police officers. Also, he wasn't afraid to make much edgier jokes. Will update this comment if I think of any more specific examples; there definitely are more.
25 years is an entire lifetime?
25 years is an entire lifetime? Maybe if you were a horse.
Interesting, I thought funny was *sub*jective. I didn't like her either, but I also don't like Larry the Cable Guy,  Kevin Hart, or a bunch of others, and I crack up over some that a lot of people don't find funny. Anyways, unless you actually have a real point to make, I bid you adieux.
Funny we can agree that in general politicians are mostly shady on both the right and the left in this sub, but in r/politics and r/democrats they deny that the left can do any wrong ever.
Remember what "politics" means, kids: Poli = Greek for "many" Ticks = small, blood sucking parasites that grow the more blood they gorge on.
I mostly agree. Trump is not an example of a good leader.IMO however the passive aggressive whataboutisms are getting old.
Reddit is partially owned by the Chinese Communist Party that banned reddit, so I'm not sure your point has any validity.
It wasn't a burn. It actually sounds just like Owens who had opposite views and switched to the other side for a good show when they realized how profitable it was. Don't be so sensitive
Well fuck the passive aggressive then.He is a piece of shit, fraud, wanna be leader who has constantly embarrassed himself over the last 4 years.He is a nepotisitic loser who surrounds himself with yes men and can't take any criticism. Fuck Donald, Jr, Eric, Ivanka, Jared and the whole fucking loser family. Melina is a emotionless moron who can't stop squinting.I hope he goes back to doing Mcdonalds commercials like he was before this shit. He is a fucking joke. Maybe he will write a book lol I can't even type that without laughing. His charity is a fraud, Trump college was a fraud, his casinos failed. Fuck this loser. Fuck any person who still listens to this jerk off. Its over bitch.Fuck Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, MSNBC, CNN and all of the news outlets they fueled his fire and base.Its been a month and he still can't admit defeat. He lost the popular vote by millions in 2020 and in 2016 said he won by a landslide WHEN HE LOST THE POLULAR VOTE. He is a narcissistic child. Fuck this clown and any moron that supports him.
1000s of dead Americans every day due to the pandemic is also getting old.It would be nice if half the country would ever start taking this seriously.I bet the pandemic won't become real for certain individuals until January 20th 2021.
You do realize that whether I call it a leading question, or a fairy tale, or call it nothing at all, that it still remains a leading question..?
Make outlandish claims without some sort of supporting evidence and then make blanket about all conservatives. No wonder conservatives find you disingenuous.
You skipped over the "unscalable" part. If you believe more dams, more wind farms, or enough solar panels can realistically be constructed to make a sizeable enough dent in the demand for coal-generated electricity, I'd need to see some numbers. What's your approach to nuclear? It could be safe and much more efficient.
Don't worry this guy will lay low for a few days then surface again with the same "conseratives are dumb" assertions.
So you're saying the people who are massively outnumbered, thanks to gun control have no weapons, and who's enemies have state support need to "rise up"?
Or he'll send private messages with his points but no proof and call you a Nazi and tell you you're what's wrong with society. Not that this has ever happened to me. /s
I have done no name calling, I'm saying its ignorant to do so. I said its moronic to take the word of 0.01% of scientists, do you do this? If not it was not an attack on you in any manner. I didnt say you were a anti vax either, I said its a similar argument that anti vaxxers make.Every thing is not a personal attack on you, some serious cognitive dissonance.This sub literally locks 90% of posts so it can be an echochamber, this is not an "Adult place". It used to be, but it is not post TD getting banned. Lots of sites literally have me labeled as a con and I can't even get a moderate flair here lmao.Now its time for some shit talking:For a group that calls people snow flakes and talks about safe spaces alot, you guys sure do cry alot in your safe spaces.
Of course they can do so, that isn't what I am arguing. They shouldn't because lying is wrong. And yes it is propaganda don't put words in my mouth.
Every time Catherine would turn on the microwave, I'd piss my pants and forget who I was for about half an hour.(Sorry, I had to do it.)
Only twenty years? I'd be surprised if mental health isn't the worst it's been since the Great Depression.
Mental health is not really important, socialization is not worth the huge risk. Church is dangerous too. Work is okay though as long as it's with amazon. we're stoping the flu this year! this flu doesn't stand a chance with Biden in charge!
Apparently the late 90s were super great
Of course they did. They are fake news.
So you're saying that NBC edited a critical fact?  So like a dispatcher asking a caller what the subject in question's race is?
Wait...a News outlet not showing the entire story???? Blasphemy
Where are all the r/politics shills? Why don't you bunch of ass holes pin this story to your shitty sub.
We need anti-bias laws for our news channels.
Wait, a major media company, formerly a source of news tempered by the demands of journalism, is now altering the information it is presenting as news? Well, I never...It's actually gotten to the point that a media company factually presenting something that doesn't mesh with their obvious and overt bias/worldview would be news. Stories as posted are not particularly newsworthy except to those who haven't yet been paying attention.
It isn't about safety, it's about control. It's always been that way, ever since the first time the government thought it had the right to order you around.
The msm at its finnest. They never show how much of hypocrites the leftist are.
The ability of liberals to lie so methodically and effortlessly is grotesque and inhuman. It's like dealing with a psychopath. I have a hard time even looking at it, I force myself.
They agreed to not be bias as part of their station license with the FCC. I blame inaction at that agency as much as the stations shortcomings
And which magical bias-free entities shall write and evaluate those laws?
We had Fairness Doctrine from FCC for broadcast channels hntil the 90s.
Critical thinking is an important life skill.
Its a reference to how george zimmerman's 911 call was edited to make him look racist.
Business owners are the new kulaks.
Our news channels are ran by very rich people who are connected with those in power. They have a financial interest in supporting politicians who will further their agenda.What is the agenda of massive corporations you ask? Lower taxes. More migration so that they can hire cheap labor. Shutting down the country so that small businesses die, therefor giving more market share to massive corporations. They want big bank bail outs, and low interest rates to prop up wall street. They want Chinese money, and African labor.
Me too.  Just got back from breakfast.
Leftists spoiled babies have others do the thinking for them.
Yes. For the unaware, Zimmerman called 911 when he first spotted Martin. Explained who he was (neighborhood watch), why he was following Martin (there'd been break-ins with things stolen),  and gave a brief physical description. The operator asked for more information,  such as what race. Zimmerman said he thought Black but couldn't be sure. NBC got a hold of the tapes and removed the statement about how there'd been break-ins and the questions by the operator about the appearance of Martin. The recording that was played said, "I'm following someone... I think he's Black."
Dont be obtuse.   The double standards in LA right now are disgusting.
Hope he gets well soon. He's doing a great fight that many others wouldn't dare pick up and is a great man.
They're the party of wishing death on people but then crying about "unity."
The people who want to control our health care also want anyone to the right of Karl Marx to die of wuflu.
Only a matter of time before news like this started to leak given that crazy tech they just used
....but CNN calls this fake news because it was not an anonymous source and was a real recording
