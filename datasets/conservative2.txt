Withdrawal from the Middle East (correction: and Central Asia) is definitely a good thing, but it should be remembered that a withdrawal after war without stabilizing the region sufficiently usually leads to more unrest (and is part of what started all this).<END_COMMENT>
He's been trying to keep this promise for his whole term. Apparently he has been lied to by officials seeking to keep the troops there. How nothing ever happens to literal treason like this ill never know. This is the timcast episode I learned about it from:

https://youtu.be/KKKnAG2CPno<END_COMMENT>
let's discuss this, I'm leaning a bit conservative but I also don't want trump.

my argument: afghanistan was and probably still is a breeding ground for terrorism, I'm all for troops leaving but the fact he wants to do it before leaving office means it's going to be rushed, rushing withdrawals is never a good thing. and if he does it, there's no going back, trying to retrieve it will cost too many lives...

a withdrawal is alright, as long as it's perfectly planned<END_COMMENT>
He was already trying to but the unelected generals and bureaucrats straight faced lied to him about troop levels.

I think that‚Äôs the play, it‚Äôs harder to send them back if he does this. Last time he announced a withdrawal, the day before, a bombshell was leaked ‚Äúrussian bounties,‚Äù and the plan was quickly voted against.<END_COMMENT>

Well r/politics was literally saying it was authoritarian by putting the US at danger. basically TLDR: "hey if you remove the troops, then that will turn our allies against us and force US to go back, and by going back, we will make everyone mad and more people will die, especially when we leave"

so now its authoritarian to not protect the world<END_COMMENT>

Honestly, if the left would've just worked with him, I'm sure some good stuff would get done. He's not as far right as the left seems to be. But the left just had to demonize him. I hope the guy gets another 4 years, but it seems bleak at this point.<END_COMMENT>
I mean, he‚Äôs been trying to do it since he was elected. The deep state military has been fighting it tooth and mail for 4 years.<END_COMMENT>
Not all of us.  I'll applaud him if he actually does it.  I was disappointed when Obama did not manage it.  And I have no hopes Biden will do it.<END_COMMENT>
My concern is that its so sudden. Keeping troops there for 4 years and 2 months before he's out (pending court battles blah blah blah) he decided to pull them out? This smells so fishy. How long will his plan take? Is it going to take 6 months, where the currently sitting president has to decide whether to move forward on the previous president's promise? What if the details aren't ironed out by then and the next president has to figure it out? What about the potential backlash of pulling troops out that the current president doesn't have to handle?

I have no issue pulling troops out (and want it), but there are so many things that can go wrong when the man who pulls the trigger doesn't have to claim responsibility after.<END_COMMENT>

The US \*has\* been pulling out of not only Afghanistan but also the Middle East more broadly. Retrenchment has been a major priority under Trump, it's only natural that he'd want to see it done before he leaves office

Arguably, this has been an even longer time coming, as Obama initiated the "Pivot to Asia" and middle-east withdrawal during his second term, something I think we should give him some credit for<END_COMMENT>

Literal treason? And you reached that conclusion from listening to some Podcast?

The Taliban now control 80% of Afghanistan again (area wise). Without US support, the regime in Kabul is a goner. Guaranteed. It might be over even with US support and cutting our losses might be the best way. I don't know. But I do know that that should be a decision made on the best *current* information, by those with the best expertise, not because of a Trump election promise back when he didn't receive any intelligence briefings.

We can get out and see what happens. It's gonna be an Islamic state again. It will probably be a safe haven for terrorists again. It might become even worse than it was before (think nuclear weapons, for example). It definitely won't be US friendly for at least a generation. Evaluating that risk and the costs, that's something I expect my government to take responsibility for.<END_COMMENT>

Fracking, one of the best ways for us to get off the middle east oil dependency and cut off cash flow to terrorist cells. But no, let's keep buying oil from people who throw gays off of roofs and put women in bee keeper costumes. Let's keep buying oil with the blood and bodies of our own children.

Are you suggesting leaving Afghanistan will cause gas prices to increase?

Further, are you suggesting an increase in gas prices would NOT be due to a Biden presidency? It would be Trumps fault??

You fucking people will blame Trump for literally every bad thing. This is amazing. Seriously, go back to all the other Reddit areas you have and leave this one alone. What joy do you get out of it??

That‚Äôd be like me going to r/Democrats and trolling. I have no interest. Then again, we don‚Äôt shove our position down peoples throats and berate them until they submit. Big difference.<END_COMMENT>
What oil is there in Afghanistan? Also, under Trump, the US has been a net exporter of oil, meaning we no longer need any oil from the Middle East. (Petro-dollar is a different story) 

After the death of the Iranian general, support for Sunni and Shia radicals is at a low, meaning there isn‚Äôt much need for more intervention in the region in general. 

Of course, the price of oil will go up again should Biden enact his ‚Äúgreen‚Äù proposals thus pushing US manufacturing abroad to regions like China where there are zero environmental regulations and cause the US to need middle eastern oil again where our price will be subject to the whims of opec again.

It‚Äôs crazy how little you know about the world yet still try to spread your idiotic ramblings with others<END_COMMENT>
I can kinda sorta see a benefit to squashing stuff as it pops up before it turns into a bigger problem (ISIS) but there are people in Afghanistan that weren't even alive in 2001. No more long draw out conflicts, the military should only be engaged with a clear victory condition and then it should be unleashed at it's full capacity, no holds barred. If it's not bad enough to do that, it's not bad enough to get involved.<END_COMMENT>

Not even. Biden voters have nothing but disdain for people of color that vote Republican or lean right. Racial equality only matters when their brown/black skin pets are on their side.

While you‚Äôre right that this sounds good on paper, democracy isn‚Äôt outright accepted in some of these countries (see: What happened in Egypt).

It's funny you say that. The people on the left say exactly the same thing about the 8 years with Obama - if the right would have just worked with him, some good stuff would have gotten done.

The fact is, the divide between the two parties is almost insurmountably large right now. Our representatives are taking an all-or-nothing approach, absolutely unwilling to compromise. This isn't the fault of only the left or only the right, though I would argue that is the right that is being more obstinate than the left.<END_COMMENT>

We allow its more stable neighbors to do their job.  Russia and Pakistan are stabilizing factors.  While Russia will look for economic development and transport of resources, Pakistan's best interest is a quiet Afghanistan so it can focus its attention on India.

Russian investment and ISI's counterterrorism efforts can give everyone what they want - the US permanently out of a quagmire, the only justification was buried at sea a long time ago, Russia gets its pipelines and the ISI gets political control.  Its far from perfect, but nothing in that region is.<END_COMMENT>

There's a lot of clear reasons why America has to have bases around the world. It has to do with sovereignty and protecting America's allies. I.e. if China decides to re-take Taiwan and America can't protect it, it'll be a humongous failure and probably the tipping point as China becoming the world's leader. 

I highly suggest you read Ray Dalio's new book about international relations and economics. It describes the current escalated tensions with China and how America is losing its grip as the world's leader.<END_COMMENT>

Joggers are typically people that are doing illegal activities that the media is dishonest about.  A black man doing something illegal isn‚Äôt a jogger.  A black man doing something illegal and the media acts like it‚Äôs the victims fault, is a jogger. 

For example, if you are a black man trying to take away someone‚Äôs legally carried gun, and get shot, but the media says you were an innocent ‚Äújogger‚Äù.. that makes you a jogger. 

However, you could also be an innocent antifa jogger just innocently jogging someones memory with a bike lock as well. In that context, it doesn‚Äôt care about the color of your skin.<END_COMMENT>
ODDS:

1 in 20 - A black person will be killed by another black person.


1 in 40,000  - A black person will be killed by a police officer acting lawfully and with good reason.


1 in 40,000,000 - A black person will be killed by a police officer acting unlawfully and with excessive force. 


Which one of these things are the most impactful to the leftists that perpetuate the narrative that all police are bad and that they are all indiscriminately killing 'mostly peaceful' black folks?

It's exceptionally easy to see that police are vilified in this country, by people who would cry foul if they left their neighborhoods. 

The problem that black people have is exactly the same problem that poor densely packed white trailer parks have. Poverty and Crime go hand in hand, especially when the parents are not there. I don't understand why they don't understand, but I think it has a lot to do with being/playing the victim. The victim is always blameless.<END_COMMENT>
And the correct term for the POS who got arrested is "alleged assaulter".  Saying alleged assault would make it appear that it was uncertain if an assault took place.  There is no uncertainty whatsoever that the assault happened, but the writer said "alleged assault".  The assault was documented on video.  The victim is confirmed as Rick Moranis.  The only thing that remains alleged is the identity of the attacker. 

Sometimes an attack can be alleged, like Juicy Smollet alleged.<END_COMMENT>

Yes, 'protesting' extremely rare unjustified violence by police by attacking conservatives all over the country makes perfect sense.          

I'd be curious what you think of this video of a woman and young girl screaming and fleeting the protestors in DC Saturday night while they scream obscenities at them, throw shit at them, and grab them. Seriously watch the video and tell me what you think? It's fine right?

This needs to be upvoted excessively. It is almost impossible to understate how important the 1st Amendment (in its current form) is to freedom of debate, criticism, etc in this country. I know people who left communist countries and were thrilled when they could come here and speak openly about whatever they wanted to. Stuff like this scares the living daylights out of them (and me).<END_COMMENT>
I‚Äôve come to realize a lot of people have a very hard time understanding principles and instead they let the emotions run their thinking.

Do I think people who use hate speech are wrong? Yes. Should they be allowed to say it? Yes, even if it‚Äôs a detriment or offensive towards me. The principle of free speech means no one gets to choose what can and can‚Äôt be said because it‚Äôs never going to be applied equally if you start picking and choosing what is and isn‚Äôt hate speech. People should have safety from government retribution. You use the wrong words at the wrong time you‚Äôre gonna get your ass kicked but the government doesn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with that.

I think people that burn US flags are assholes. I get on with my day because it‚Äôs their freedom of expression and it shouldn‚Äôt be illegal. There are some on the right as well and they that think that should be illegal. It‚Äôs not just people on the left struggling with the idea of the principle of the 1st amendment. 

It‚Äôs like the people who watch South Park and go that‚Äôs funny and that‚Äôs okay until they target whatever category they are then it‚Äôs not okay and the show should be kicked off the air.<END_COMMENT>

The thing is it won‚Äôt be applied objectively. Just like how they changed the definition of racism so it can‚Äôt include anything against whites people (go read the new definition if you haven‚Äôt), it will be hate speech when it‚Äôs against certain groups but just fine when it‚Äôs against white people or any other group lower on the intersectionality pyramid.<END_COMMENT>
That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve changed the definition of ‚Äúracism‚Äù to basically be the exact same, but with ‚Äúexcept towards white people‚Äù at the end. Don‚Äôt believe me? [Check out what the mods at /pics had to say when I asked why they let some dude call me a collection of racial slurs over a period of two days.](https://i.redd.it/3eltc5tnwnr51.png)

Now, I‚Äôm not saying that the big brains at the /pics moderation team is the end all be all when it comes to definitions of words, but the fact that this is an accepted point of view anywhere, and it‚Äôs actually being taught in universities should alarm anyone that‚Äôs white. It‚Äôs the typical dehumanizing rhetoric, the accusations that white people are the source of all evil in our nation, the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre coming for us!‚Äù, etc that all precludes the ‚Äúwe have to take them out before they can do it again‚Äù rhetoric that leads to a genocide.

They will apply a majority/minority filter to it.  Therefore, hate speech against Christians is ok because the nation is majority Christian.  Then someone will be tried for hate speech as Islam, and their lawyer will demonstrate the planet is majority Islamic and then they will throw that argument out and trust reliable, court tested, feelings instead of objective evidence.

Take several generations of a people, make life sustainable for single mothers but unsustainable for married couples with children, remove mothers from their children and send them to menial jobs in the name of equality, designing powerpoints or organizing useless seminars, have those children raised by strangers without the comfort of family, and then instruct these emotionally damaged children that all their problems are the result of an unfair system set against them by another group, and focus their hatred, uncontrollable aggression and violence against that group, and then reshape language to protect that group from laws penalizing attacks motivated solely by their ethnic backgrounds.

Demonize anyone who wants actual equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes, as literally Hitler, and watch the madness unfold.

I ask all of you to stop doing business in these hives of scum and villainy known as American cities.  Leave these cesspools to their own demise.  Leave these violent sociopaths conditioned by the system to experience rage at seeing anyone of different ethnic background existing, or members of their own group expressing differing opinions, in these shitholes to rot.

Why this is so important

1. This vaccine can be stored at the normal 3¬∞C temp vaccines are usually stored at vs -70¬∞C required for the Pfeizer Vaccine making it much easier and cheaper to store and distribute the vaccine. 

2. It's inoculation time is 28 days as opposed to almost 60 days for the Pfizer one allowing us to be immune much quicker and get back on track

3. It has a high effective rate(95%) which means even if the non-vaxxers refuse to take the vaccine we'll likely have herd immunity from the rest populace only. 

4. Both the vaccines are based on the m-RNA activation site so if one gets approved the other will most likely too!

I respect and support Trump, but I‚Äôm not gonna be the first in line. Just saying. Probably rely on my immune system like always.<END_COMMENT>
Still....no thanks to the vaccine.<END_COMMENT>
The companies said they‚Äôd be ready around this time, and the German-engineered vaccine that Pfizer had been testing happened to be first. Trump had nothing to do with it at all. 

And yes, I‚Äôd say the exact same thing for Biden, had he been president, or anyone else. The US President does not directly lead the work to develop vaccines. Warp Speed serves to guarantee these companies a buyer *when* the vaccine is ready, and handles the distribution of it once acquired. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs vaccine‚Äù in any way, shape or form, and he didn‚Äôt predict anything that wasn‚Äôt told to him by experts.<END_COMMENT>
To be clear, neither of these vaccines is actually ready. They haven't even applied for FDA approval yet and they can't for a few more weeks. We are likely looking at several months before approval and distribution is possible.

That being said, based in my experience in healthcare I imagine that both companies are probably already ramping up production in anticipation of FDA approval.<END_COMMENT>
Hi, I lived in two covid hotspots so far during the pandemic and was a healthcare worker, now med student.

The problem is not necessarily death rates. It's hospitalization rates.

A lot of people with covid end up occupying lots of hospital space and put a lot of strain on our medical systems. This is a problem because it can incapacitate or kill our medical workers, but also when hospitals are full, we will have problems taking care of actual emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, gunshot wounds, and so on.

Also consider that even if a hospital has beds available, we don't necessarily have the staff to take care of them.

Near my hometown in Idaho, our Sun Valley medical center had to completely shut down due to overwhelming number of cases for our staff and for the community.

Over the past few months, we've seen this in places from New York, Florida, Texas, and Wisconsin where capacity gets too high to manage patients as best as possible. Then people who DON'T have covid end up passing away due to overwhelmed EDs.

I recommend you check out r/medicine. There are lots of stories from full doctors and nurses about how they've been impacted by the pandemic.<END_COMMENT>
Can you show me the data that shows 99.996% survival rate? I'm actually curious<END_COMMENT>
If 0.004% survival rate is true and there are 300 million in the US, if everyone got covid, then there would be 12,000 deaths. I'm seeing 250k deaths with 12 million cases. So what gives?<END_COMMENT>
1.	even if the survival rate is that high (disputed) you‚Äôre still looking at hundreds of thousands of dead Americans in 9 months, the vast majority of which could have been avoided 
2.	a substantial number of people who get covid take months to fully recover (if they ever do), and many suffer long term organ damage that absolutely worsens their quality of life
3.	no liberals are against vaccines<END_COMMENT>
Clown comment. 1. Death rate is still pretty bad when hundreds of millions will end up being infected. This has killed more americans than entire wars. People don't need to be in the military to be upset about their passing. 
2. Just cause a vaccine has been able to be tested doesn't mean it's safe for the general public. They're prioritizing covid vaccines and pushing them through the steps as fast as possible, but it'll probably be about another year before the public has access. Sorry the lockdowns are inconvenient, but it's the only way to save lives at the moment<END_COMMENT>
You don't want your cells invaded by mRNA to reprogram them to produce the COVID spike proteins so your immune system can detect it?<END_COMMENT>

Thank you for a thorough and balanced explanation instead of just ‚ÄúiTs A lIbErAl sCaM‚Äù<END_COMMENT>
Yep, this right here is exactly what I try telling people. Covid-19, **when treated** has a very high survival rate. The issue is, a lot of people that are being hospitalized might need some high % O2 or just monitoring in order to get through it. What is currently happened in El Paso and other parts of the country, is these minor hospitalizations are being turned away due to lack of staff or beds. These hospitals being at 100% capicty are basically sending people to their **deaths** by denying them treatment. It is not their faults, it is our faults for not wearing masks and following **current** CDC guidelines. 

Since day one of the pandemic, the goal was to flatten the curve. Somewhere along the line of the last couple of weeks, people stopped trying and now more people are dying.<END_COMMENT>
Parent got confused -- it's 99.6% (which is the same as .996 -- probably the source of the confusion).

If it were 99.996%, we'd have only 15,000 deaths even if the whole country were infected.<END_COMMENT>
Op is just making shit up and people are like: yEaH sOuNs gOoD tO me DuMB LibTarDs DoNt GEt MaTH. Number is 99.6. Now people on this sub are gonna think that 99.996 is the right number and tell all their buddies and this is how misinformation gets spread.<END_COMMENT>
If I were in a vulnerable group, yes, I'll accept the vaccine. Being a healthy young adult, no thanks. Chance are high I've already been infected.<END_COMMENT>
That's a super high hospitalization rate. Especially in places with few hospital beds. Especially when most beds are already taken by other things. Boise had several days of 95%+ capacity BEFORE covid. It got so much worse during. I think we had a 400 bed facility but a population of over 200k, not including nearby cities. 0.2% hospitalization rate will put us out of business.

We didn't mix covid and non covid patients, which meant we needed double staff. A lot of which couldn't work due to exposure. I'm not saying we let trauma victims die. I'm saying we had 1 nurse for 5 patients rather than the typical 1 nurse for 2-3. If you've ever been a nurse, you know that sucks. If you're a patient, you don't feel safe (rightly so).

You acknowledge that there's a staff shortage, good.

Exactly, lots of things can overwhelm our medical system. Why make it harder on them? We need all the help we can get.

And yes, docs and nurses love telling horror stories. That does not invalidate their problems. Burnout is real. Covid is not helping.<END_COMMENT>
Again the problem isn‚Äôt you getting sick. Nobody cares about you alone being safe or not. It‚Äôs that you might get sick without even knowing it and get another 10 people sick. Maybe they all are fine but maybe they get another 100 people sick and then someone dies. Its worth it just to be cautious for another few months until this virus is gone. Better yet 1 actual lockdown for a few weeks would save thousands of lives. At the very least you owe it to your fellow citizen to wear a mask and stay out of crowds.<END_COMMENT>
what a childish outlook<END_COMMENT>
So then just say it. You're a selfish human and don't care about your countrymen. I just had covid, but I'm fine because I'm 26 and healthy. I locked myself away for two weeks to protect my community. I'll continue to avoid public spaces and gatherings because I care about my community. This isn't about you, or me, or any individual. Its about the safety of all americans.<END_COMMENT>

I'm just happy to see a heavy divide in their own party. Many don't want super radical progressivness. I also hope they give Pelosi the boot<END_COMMENT>
This election can be viewed as much as a referendum on Trump, as it was a referendum on the government as a whole.

Democrats won big in 2018 due to the rise of progressives, and their platform of riling up their base with big promises. The latter allowed them to take otherwise red seats and flip them blue.

Here we are two years later and many of those seats have flipped back to red because of how Democrats didnt followup on their promises. Instead of healthcare or housing, they went all in on investigating Trump then impeaching him for a mean sounding phone call. Voters arent the dumb idiots that the media paints them to be, its just sometimes it takes some years to catch up.

Democrats have a lot to be scared about in the next 4 years if they dont win both Georgia seats. 2022 could see them lose the house, and 2024 would see them lose the Presidency if Biden is as ineffective as he is made out to be. 

Of course, they have their problems coming this year as well..... Pelosi could lose that coveted gavel due to the far left.<END_COMMENT>

Democrats IMO are amazing at marketing but have terrible ideas. Even at the polls this year, they gave me this sexy cardboard paper with all kinds of colors on it with a list of all of the democratic candidates while the republican‚Äôs outside the polls gave me a simple sheet of printer paper with all the republican names listed.

Silly stuff like that attracts low information voters which I why they‚Äôre blasting fireworks like crazy at their events and making everything a big deal. Look at AOC‚Äôs twitter and Twitch following. 

I know that‚Äôs insanely biased to say but I‚Äôve been noticing it a lot more lately.<END_COMMENT>
Due in large part to the "Trump effect" of media driving off a cliff and moving to open propaganda instead of trying to maintain at least a thin pretense of journalism, many folks have discovered critical thinking. The media has cooperated by pushing various ridiculous narratives and breathlessly declaring sequential fabricated events to be existential crises. 

In response, many people have chosen to think for themselves, determine their own core principles and values, and examine events and ideas in the light of those principles. Some aren't there yet; my parents are staunch Democrat voters (AFAIK) as they were raised to believe Democrats support the workers, Republicans support the evil rich, and ignoring their own very conservative values. 

As the D's lurch more and more left, especially with their rhetoric, more and more folks are willing and able to examine those ideas, and understand they are antithetical to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Thus, a potential voter fraud scam focused on 4 metropolitan areas may have been able to tip the presidential vote, but was unable to greatly affect the House and Senate votes. 

And really, it's pretty easy to get a conservative to identify core values; what are the core values of the modern US media/Democrat/leftist (that they are willing to state publicly)? Fairness? Equality (but an even superficial look reveals it ISN'T equality)?<END_COMMENT>
Unlike the conservatives, the Democrats don‚Äôt have any values or principles that they can state openly. The hate our heritage, culture and our constitution ‚Äî that is pretty much their ‚Äúprinciples ‚Äú. But of course, they can‚Äôt state this openly which is why they engage in election fraud and gorilla tactics such as saying one thing and doing something else. How long can they keep up with this? Either they change their principles, change our constitution or they become complete authoritarians like the CCP. I‚Äôm betting that they will move towards the third option because California and New York already resemble that.<END_COMMENT>
I mean, there's a divide in the Conservative party, too. Dems lost seats in the House but Biden is winning the election because people are voting against Trump, not because they're voting *for* Biden. I fully expect many flipped states will flip back in 4 years if the GOP puts forth a less divisive candidate. No one who voted for Trump is suddenly going to vote against the GOP just because Trump isn't their candidate, and all those people who voted blue for President but red for Reps are going to go back to voting red for President too.<END_COMMENT>
America is more progressive than people think. You can see it in all of the progressive ballot initiatives that passed. Liberal politicians are garbage and don't actual care about their constituents. They offer half assed policies than only piss off both sides. They say dumb things like Defund the Police instead of Police Reform. Liberals are simply bad at their job in comparison to their conservative counterparts.<END_COMMENT>
To be fair... Could they have moved forward on big government promises without a blue senate?<END_COMMENT>
Except here‚Äôs the thing - all of the really progressive democratic candidates got re-elected, whereas seats that were flipped tended to be the more moderate or liberal candidates. I think that this honestly has less to do with trump and more to do with a growing ideological divide in the middle. That and strong marketing to convince people that the most middle of the road democrats are in fact crazy socialists<END_COMMENT>
> The progressives actually did better among the Democrats running.

If you mean progressives did well in safe blue districts, OK, but that doesn't mean much.<END_COMMENT>
This. Atleast Bernie and AOC are consistent in their beliefs, like them or not. The rest of the DNC is a loaded with opinion shifting talkNoWalkers. Its the one reason i personally dont like Kamala. She was the main one hsing the dnc primaries as a means to just call out everyone, and now her and Joe are childhood friends. Fuck the 2 party system.<END_COMMENT>
That sounds right. The middle is dying. We're no longer capable of having a rational middle space. Which is sad because neither side has a monopoly on the moral high ground. Neither side has a monopoly on good ideas. Neither side is inherently better. 

There once was a contest of ideas in our mythology. This gave way to a contest of personalities. Now we're in a state where it's a constant war of who can draw up the highest barriers against listening to the other side.<END_COMMENT>
You say educated, I hear indoctrinated because you're referring to four year college "formal" education. The education system has swung so far left its surprising it even functions anymore.

Black president, likely to have a black vice president. Some of the most famous and well paid people in the United States are African American athletes. It's sad that we continue to hear this rhetoric. 

What do you think it does to the black kid who wants to better himself. When he fails does he look at his actions and think "hey if I made a better decision here, or worked harder here." Nope, you're teaching them to throw their hands in the air and blame racism. Shapiro said it best, "you're teaching them that any failure is the fault of some unseen unheard monster in their closet called racism, how can anyone succeed in that situation."<END_COMMENT>
Ah, the myth of the "low information voter". People tend to be knowledgeable on subjects that most directly impact them. While the average midwestern farmer living in a homogoneous town may not be well versed in critical race theory, the average Berkeley grad living in a diverse metropolitan area is probably not going to be well versed in agricultural microeconomics. It's almost universally true that people do not want to vote against their best interests. I think it's irresponsible to shame someone as "contributing to marginalization" when they are simply doing what they think best for their community.<END_COMMENT>
Yeah, if the party does split it would go 3 ways. The far left (Bernie AOC warren etc), the moderates (Gabbard ) who would probably join a more reformed/economically liberal socially conservative Republican Party. And then the career politicians would remain on the democrat party like Biden/Harris/Booker/DeBlausio/Pelosi etc<END_COMMENT>
Ballot initiatives and support for M4A and free public college tend to disagree. Americans don't like Liberal politicians. Florida went red and still overwhemingly wanted $15 minimum wage. Arizona is like 50/50 and they still voted for a massive tax increase on the top in order to fund their public schools. Legalization of drugs in very red states. Liberal politicians suck while progressive policies up to a point don't.<END_COMMENT>

He is the polar opposite of Trump imo.

Where Trump is abrasive, no bullshit and sometimes a little unhinged whilst tweeting stuff from his bathroom at 3 AM, Obama beamed decency, respectability and he was an extremely gifted speaker. 

But hiding behind Obama's likeable persona was the worst policy package in recent memory where as Trump's policies have done so much to improve the country. As a foreigner I enjoy Trump for how much of a troll he is sometimes, but it would have benefitted the country a lot more to have his policy making skills come in a less abrasive package.<END_COMMENT>

The first was literally Obama's policy and it combats human trafficking.

The second is from leftists shutting down their states to cause economic turmoil to spite Trump.

The third is about giving options to families other than shitty public schools filled with unfireable teachers.

The fourth was about getting rid of an unconstitutional law that did nothing but make health care costs rise.

The fifth was about stopping US dependence on foreign countries that hate us.

Blue states will lock down like they already are. Most red states will stay open. Locking down doesn‚Äôt seem to have an impact on the virus because people are still going out. Per capita death rates in a red state like S.C. which has been basically open the whole time is no worse off than CA and better than places like N.Y. which suffered from mismanagement of nursing homes.

Live in a very large, rural county in a Blue state. No deaths, maybe a half dozen hospitalizations over the entire 8-9 month course of the virus but COVID just broke out in a big way in a single nursing home at one end of the county, suddenly driving the county infection rate up (still no deaths, no significant increase in hospitalizations).  

Want to guess the County reaction? New restrictions County-wide on movement, gatherings, businesses either forced to shut down or with restricted operation. This in what will probably be a vain attempt to avoid the State coming in with a total lockdown order that, after the last major lockdown, would end the majority of businesses, bankrupt a significant number of people, and kill any possibility of economic recovery for years.   

This is the kind of mindless insanity Biden is pushing.<END_COMMENT>

I live in PA and I believe they found Wolf's lockdowns unconstitutional in a court case that he lost. I can tell you that where I live, most business won't stand another lockdown.<END_COMMENT>
Wolf also stated earlier this summer that he was not going to make anymore blanket restrictions across the whole state and then about a week later shit down all bars and slashed indoor restaurant capacity to 25% state wide.

You can‚Äôt trust a word he says.

Add in the fact that he is about to have his summit with Cuomo and Murphy about a coordinated response tells me he is going to do something this week.

However, on the left, I have seen a gradual weakening of NAZI, that is celebrated. Not only is there a blanket refusal to use the proper word, NEO nazi ( because what passes these days as a neo nazi would have been classified as mentally deficcient in 1940 germany, and "purged"), but also a big part of a disdain for jewish life. 

Personally, I think the two are linked. 

You can not weaken up the label of NAZI, without justifying and praising the actions of the german government in 1940. "the holocaust was not an incomparable act of cruelty, look everybody, a president elect was just as bad. "

Also, short history quiz, the winner can have a fizzy drink on me. 

A group of fringe radicals, riled up by comspiracy grade theories about hidden priviledge of certain members of society, goes into inner cities, beats up people, and "tries to shut it down". They are very loud, love fighting with the police, whom they view as inherently directed buy this priviledged group, and their main gripe does not exist, it is a laundry list of gripes, and all of them sum up to "untill the whole system changes, we will not go away. " Later on, everyone who participated kind of goes, well, we were there to protest peacefully, it was certain people who wore masks and such, did some shit, and then very quickly ran away. 

OH, and most of the businesses in the city mysteriously catch fire, and are left to burn. 

IF you answered "that sounds like the kenosha riots, or the saint paul riots, or the portland riots, or any of the riots taking place there", really? I said HISTORY....

Look up what a Reichsprogromnacht is. And coincidentially, the anger was also against the percieved 1 %, that all had very easily identifiable characteristics, and anyone who wanted to protect them also landed on the chopping block. As they say, once you have an other, the first step is easy to do. 

Very interresting how history repeats itself.<END_COMMENT>

By that definition Obama is hitler too. Biden will be as well.<END_COMMENT>

I had a great history teacher in HS that spent ALOT of time on WW2 and how things led up to Hitler. He did this to make sure that we were able to recognize the signs that history was threatening to repeat.

Very unifying of Harris and Biden to not denounce the violence that happened in DC this weekend. 

Don‚Äôt pass us the olive branch. We aren‚Äôt interested.<END_COMMENT>
I was an Obama Democrat. Loved the guy, the inspiration, the "unity" message. Hated Trump in 2016 with a vengeance. He was going to be the worst President ever. Boy, was I brainwashed!

Over the last 4 years, I have seen Trump roll up policy victory after policy victory, things that made sense, while the "Unity"-crats screamed and shouted and encouraged lawlessness. It was shameful.

Somewhere over the last 4 years I woke up. My parents live in Canada and I'd always identified with the older, now defunct Progressive Conservative party. Emphasis on the conservative part. When I separated out the screaming from the Democrats and what they were actually saying, I realized the Dems were not actually saying anything. Nothing. At. All. 

So I went all in conservative again. And it's shameful to see the reactions post-election. The refusals to consider fraud, the attempt to paint Trump as a gas-lighter, the glee in seeing him defeated. It's a dangerous place out there. I'm thankful for this sub and for others I've met along the way who reminded me that it's okay, and perfectly normal, to embrace conservative values.<END_COMMENT>
I'll be ok with unity if the Democrat party looked out for Americans first rather than caring so much about illegals, deporting illegals is a bipartisan issue by 3/4 of the population yet the liberal elites keep letting them in.<END_COMMENT>
Unity requires we have some common ground. I just don't know what that common ground would be...Immigration? Taxes? Healthcare? "Justice"? Faith? The sanctity of the Constitution?<END_COMMENT>

For the last four years we have been called racists, homophobs, cheaters, nazis,and every other name they can think of. Now that they think they have the Whitehouse Biden and Harris are calling for unity? I don't think so. Not while your party has yet to denounce the antifa and blm attacks and violence, not while the Dems have called for making a list of trump supporters so they can interrupt our lives, and not while your party continues to fight to remove our God given rights. You see we believe that we have rights and the constitution doesn't give us those rights it just affirms the rights we have.<END_COMMENT>
We will not compromise our values and let the leftists walk all over us. We have our rights and freedoms and we deserve to make our own choices.<END_COMMENT>
I‚Äôll push for unity the day the democrats admit the ‚ÄúRussian collusion‚Äù story was a hoax, they embrace civil liberties again, and they admit their supporters are the ones rioting.

It is ironic that the olive branch they have extended is to beat us into submission. They talk of comprise and yet they give up nothing and we surrender everything. It reminds me of the Pax Romano offered the Celts by Caesar. A Roman peace is you do as Rome says and they won‚Äôt place you on a cross. If the four years of Trump will be remembered as a four year temper tantrum by the left. Then the four years of Biden will be remembered as four years of retribution. Peace and compromise will be achieved once we have been throughly flogged and agree that we will never make the mistake of thinking and voting for ourselves again. In other words either we climb on our metaphorical crosses willingly or we will be forced there with Trump‚Äôs portrait nailed neatly above our heads.<END_COMMENT>

The ACLU once defended the rights of Neo-Nazis to march through Skokie, IL, which at the time had the highest concentration of Holocaust survivors in the world.  That was back when the ACLU was an admirable organization that fought for civil liberties; now it‚Äôs just another anti-American group fighting for Progressivism.<END_COMMENT>
I mean please elaborate, Nazism doesn‚Äôt really fall under Democrat or Republican, specially back in the I believe Late 20th century, 70s or 80s? The ACLU literally defended Nazis and had something like 10k members leave and lost thousands in revenue, the lawyer who defended them was constantly harrassed and shit on for doing so, but the ACLU as a whole still went forward to defend literal Nazis despite the whole of America shitting on them for doing so because they believed in free speech. 

I disagree that the ACLU has crumbled, but you saying the ACLU has NEVER represented constitutional liberties is just fundamentally wrong and plain ignorant<END_COMMENT>

This has been happening on a national level for a while. Notice they don't say "minorities" anymore, they say "black and brown people". Specifically excluding Asians.

But if it suits the left's "fuck whitey" propaganda, then we are included. For example, the media decided to treat us like minorities when they wanted to report on how hate crimes against Asians have increased "due to Trump's rhetoric". But for some reason they often don't focus on the race of the perpetrators attacking the Asians UNLESS they happen to be white. 

Shit like this is what I notice all the time.<END_COMMENT>
Asians, I welcome you to the white category.<END_COMMENT>
Here's an idea: instead of race baiting with identity politics, why not just label the category impoverished or underprivileged students that can include those of any skin color or background... You know, have subsidies based on someone's actual need rather than having such benefits based on the color of someone's skin.<END_COMMENT>

You have to step back and look at *why* they did this. 

If they made it white vs non-white, Asians being lumped in with persons of color, it didn‚Äôt tell the story they wanted to tell. The Asians ruined the narrative they were trying to sell. So they recategorized them as white and ta-da... they got the narrative they were looking for.<END_COMMENT>

I'm of Indian origin. When they started using the word brown. I was like oh I can play the "I'm brown and I'm oppressed" card as a joke. I was quickly corrected with brown means hispanic/latino.

Or does it mean middle eastern too? Color obsession is getting out of hand.<END_COMMENT>
You‚Äôre so right about this. They think of minorities solely based on their ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù status. To them, someone is only a minority if that person is a victim of racism. I‚Äôm biracial with white and Asian blood, as my dad is Japanese and my mom is white. As far as I know, my family hasn‚Äôt really had to deal with racism, at least from what my dad says. But that doesn‚Äôt mean my family on my dad‚Äôs side isn‚Äôt a minority. It doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt perpetually feel a simultaneous white and ‚Äúother‚Äù identity (because I do).

I've lived in several regions and I haven't found that to be the case at all. Asians are almost exclusively people who look like Chinese/Japanese/Korean. They also usually include SE Asians (Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese). However, South Asians are usually just called "Indian" whether they are Indian or not. I've never heard an American refer to a South Indian as Asian unless it was part of some poll or publication that lumped people based on continent. In casual conversation, Asian almost never refers to people from South Asia in America. Which is strange because it's almost exactly the opposite in the U.K.<END_COMMENT>

I understand that you don't want special treatment because of your race, but how would you feel if your son or daughter didn't get into a certain college or get a job because they're Asian? Is that fair?<END_COMMENT>
I always feel like affirmative action is reverse racism and especially against Asians since we‚Äôre now not only a minority but we‚Äôre a minority that doesn‚Äôt get the benefits of a program designed for minorities. The recent case against Harvard a few years ago addresses just this. Sucks that we have to work even harder when it‚Äôs already in our nature to work hard just so we can get on the same playing ground as everyone else.<END_COMMENT>
 No one faces discrimination on a systemic level. The difference between races is in their own agency. Asians are typically more successful because they don't feed into the victim narrative. It's about taking responsibilities for yourself and your actions, and not blaming everyone else for your problems. Because if you take responsibility for yourself, and you fail, you are driven to do better.  But if you always think your failures are the result of a system designed to keep you down and hold you back, you're never driven to try harder or do better.  You're also more likely to result to criminal behavior because you feel you have to cheat to win.<END_COMMENT>
Good for you. I'm white and don't think it's right for minorities to get preferential treatment over my kids in such instances either. It's wrong.<END_COMMENT>
The left‚Äôs racial neo-segregation stuff is wrong, period. There are plenty of poor white Americans too. I am European immigrant whose parents (they live in Europe) are piss poor.

Koreans and Vietnamese are not the same people.<END_COMMENT>
I don't know what benefit I have over you because I'm white, but I agree that it's ridiculous that someone in this school district made the decision that Asians aren't a minority.

No, but life isn‚Äôt fair. Growing up, my parents always taught me I‚Äôd have to work twice as hard to get into a top college. So I did. Maybe I could‚Äôve gotten into my dream school (which actually got sued for discriminating against Asians lol) if I‚Äôd been a different race, but it does me no good to be angry about it. Instead, now I‚Äôm working even harder so I can try to get into its law school. It‚Äôs the way the system is, barring any major changes. And I would teach my own children to do the same ‚Äî to work hard against the disadvantages they face.<END_COMMENT>
I don't know what's worse.. not getting accepted into a school because of my race.. or getting accepted into a school because of my race.

As an Asian immigrant, what I experienced was that there was nothing racist with "the system".

The only racism I faced was from individuals. If anything, it was the system that held everything together.

I truly believe the moment we start putting quotas and regulations based on race, that would be the start of systemic racism.

The reason I had to work twice as hard is because English is my second language. I'm sure that if some white person was trying to get into a top college in Korea, they would have to try twice as harder than the Koreans.<END_COMMENT>
Absolutely right. I see much more pushback from the Asian community nationwide more this election year than ever in regards to woke policies and indoctrination. It's only fitting to stand up against such practices that compromise fairness for all just for the sake of rigging numbers for a select group.<END_COMMENT>

Yes, but I also grew up in a town that‚Äôs highly competitive (30% of the students at my high school were Asian and we were all fighting for a spot at a top 20 college). So it might be easier for people in different areas.

FWIW I think you should just tell your kids to work their hardest (which I‚Äôm sure you already do!), because that‚Äôs the only thing you can really do in this kind of system.<END_COMMENT>
Because it‚Äôs harder to get in as an Asian (you need higher stats). Maybe not twice as hard, but harder. And there‚Äôs also the fact that my town has a ton of legacy kids, which leaves less room for everyone else.<END_COMMENT>
You know how in sports they just hire the best athletes? Some sports like hockey have a lot of white players. Some like basketball or football have a lot of black players. That‚Äôs just equality. If you‚Äôre the best then you deserve it. When it comes to academics it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Asians know they will never be allowed to dominate the academic space like this. Knowing this, Asian parents push this kids to insane lengths to be not just the best but the best Asian student. Because we‚Äôre not competing against everyone else. We‚Äôre competing to displace another Asian student. Don‚Äôt ask me about what I had to give up in high school to maintain my 4.0 GPA. I lost my childhood to studying. 

‚ÄúCurrently, Asian-American students, who represent about 5% of public high school students, make up 22.9% of Harvard‚Äôs freshman class. Harvard data released as part of the lawsuit showed that admitted Asian-American students have a higher average SAT score and lower rate of admission than any other racial group. It also revealed that Asian-Americans would make up 43% of Harvard‚Äôs admitted class if only academics were considered.‚Äù

Glad to share notes with someone on the same wavelength. Every culture/race has its own biases against others and can hold intra-group biases as well. Overcoming barriers starts from within but unfortunately there's too much blaming and not enough effort to make one's situation better.<END_COMMENT>

Yes, of course. I just don‚Äôt know how. The lawsuit I‚Äôm talking about (Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard) might go to SCOTUS, which makes me hopeful. I‚Äôd like to see a world where my own kids don‚Äôt have to work twice as others.<END_COMMENT>
I agree. I am familiar with that lawsuit and I hope that the Asian plaintiff wins the case. If not, this country's Constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on.<END_COMMENT>

It'll be interesting. Rumor has it that Trump's people have been kicking the tires at Newsmax. Doesn't mean anything's going to happen. CNN is currently being shopped around by AT&T. I would love to see Trump buy them both. Take advantage of CNN's distribution deals and bring on Newsmax's personalities. Tucker and Hannity will eventually cross over, causing Fox News' value to bottom out, at which point they'll be purchased by OANN.

Not realistic, I know, but it's nice to dream of a better world.<END_COMMENT>
This is the way. I hope Tucker goes to Newsmax.<END_COMMENT>
Way fox is killing it's viewership, trump could pick it up at fire sale prices and hannity and tucker wont even have to change their badges lol. Then buy newsmax also.<END_COMMENT>

I don't understand this. CNN has been around since the 1980s. Trump has only been president for 4 years.

Their viewership was rapidly declining pre-Trump.

I don't think he deserves a down vote for his question. 
The reason is because there isn't unbiased news any longer. There's really Globalist news and National news now. Each reinforces its business model. Most news outlets are owned by Billionaires that hold multinational and global business holdings. They have a clear advantage from a weak American economy and it helps for them to propagandize along those lines.<END_COMMENT>

A lot of people (mostly young people in the left) don‚Äôt understand the concept of assets and liabilities. Every business person has debts. That doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is the interest rate you pay vs your revenues and current assets. It‚Äôs not worth paying off your entire debt if the potential revenue you make of that capital is more than the interest rate on your debt. Additionally many business debts can be a tax write off if you have a competent accountant. Despite all this cnn will post an article: ‚ÄúLol Orange man has millions in debt‚Äù.

Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but I would much rather hope that our democracy is still intact and not so full of corruption that the people‚Äôs vote is meaningless. If there is corruption, I hope it is found and stomped out with great prejudice. But I do not hope that there is any fraud because that would be incredibly harmful for our democracy. This feels like the left hoping Trump was a Russian asset so that he would get impeached. If that were true, it would‚Äôve been terrible for America and its future and it felt very wrong for them to have been actively hoping that was the case. This election fraud hope feels strangely similar.<END_COMMENT>

Yeah, that wouldn't be fair since he wouldn't have proven anything in that scenario regarding fraud flipping the election. It would be twisting the arm of the republic at best, a coup at worst. Either way, it would be very bad for the country.

The title is referencing a Trump tweet that actually suggests 2.7 million were deleted. The president can provide no source for that number and further in the article you can read:

"A national coalition that includes the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Association of State Election Directors said there is a lack of evidence supporting the claim that voting software deleted or switched votes in the election.

'There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,' a¬†joint statement¬†from the coalition said, and called the 2020 election 'the most secure in American history.'"

If that 2.7 million number was real then it could be submitted in court and the case would be taken seriously. The amount of cases that the Trump campaign and RNC have submitted that have been immediately dismissed or withdrawn by their lawyers, along with the quotes from agencies within his own administration, should tell you the validity of these claims.<END_COMMENT>
Of course it‚Äôs not true.<END_COMMENT>
Did you look for a fact check to see if this is true? It's actually not.<END_COMMENT>
Thing is, this election has a terrible outcome regardless of how we look at it. You already listed the first scenario, our system is deeply flawed, corruption is at its peak, and there is no trust in any future elections, the divide will be pretty big.

The second scenario is also equally as bad though. If Biden won this election fairly, this is probably a sad moment in US history. Really think about it, the most uncharismatic candidate ever produced with the most unlikeable VP just won the election without doing any campaigns and relying on social media and mainstream media to carry them to the finish line. Alone this would be fine, but they went against Donald Trump, whether you like him or not, you cannot deny how hard he campaigned. There are more days biden called a lid during his campaign than he was actually on the trail while trump in some instances would zip around the country and do 3 1hr+ rallies a day, I believe even the day before election day, he set a record with 5 or 6.

The second scenario just means this: Campaigning doesnt matter, rallying doesnt matter, what matters is the narrative the media has set. No matter how hard you try to prove your cause and promote your ideas, if big tech doesnt approve of you as a candidate, the censorship alone will prevent you from making it anywhere no matter how hard you work because low information voters would much rather trust the narrative blindly rather than investigate and do their own research. It would in the end mean that we do not live in a real democracy, but rather in an oligarchy, where the amount of money you have and the influence over the media you have will be enough to decide elections alone.

Personally, i prefer the fraud scenario (even though its awful honestly, and id much rather biden be a charismatic candidate who also campaigned his heart out, and then won because he was just better, regardless of whether i agree with him or not), but i really dont see us as a people making it out of this in a way where we still have faith in our institutions.<END_COMMENT>

The left hates America 

What else is new?<END_COMMENT>
A few things:

1) No, Trump is not ignoring the COVID related news, that is just a smear attack used to gaslight the population into thinking that anyone who isn't a Democrat is useless.

2) The COVID mortality count has been suspect since the start.  People who didn't die of COVID were found to have died of COVID because hospitals were falsely claiming COVID as the reason for death because the government was paying money for that to the hospitals.  

3) This Chicken Little shit of screaming that the world is coming to an end and that we're all going to die of COVID unless the Democrats are running things is getting a bit stale.  There is NOTHING that the Dems could have done that the Trump administration has not already done.  The government is not going to create a vaccine, that is up to the pharmacy corporations.  Hell, when Trump promoted Hydroychlorinique (or whatever the hell that was), the press and the Democrats bitched about it, attacked Trump for mentioning it even though there are other nations that are using it and it works (Maybe you all should have been pushing for Unity at the start of a pandemic instead of trying to make Trump look bad for your own political agenda).

4) Biden hasn't won, the election isn't over.  

5) You're a partisan hack.  You know Biden can't magically end this pandemic and make COVID go away, you just want Trump gone.

6) No, that is not how the Constitution works.  I know I am not an elected Democratic Official, but I know that the Constitution isn't made of play-doh.  It wasn't written to be bent and stretched to make what you want to happen happen.<END_COMMENT>

That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get, people act if Clinton won (or even some typical GOP person) there would have only been like 10 deaths.

And the fact that 200,000 deaths by October was the best case in March.<END_COMMENT>

This is the exact question we all want to know. Biden ran saying he‚Äôd take on the pandemic with...more testing??  No one is claiming they can‚Äôt get a test. How does that help at all?  His only plan is to try to shut down the economy, and the governors actually have power there.<END_COMMENT>

If this pandemic would have struck during the Obama administration, I guarantee that we would be in the same place we are now with the volume of cases. Our country failed on many levels with the virus, yet Trump is the only one people blame. Nothing will change under Biden.<END_COMMENT>

Exactly this. I‚Äôm not a Trump fan, but I can tell when the media is just bandwagoning on blaming him for a pandemic that really no one can control. Sure, there are countries like New Zealand that got it under control early on, but look at the population/demographics and the fact that it is an island.

No way we could do something like that here, that‚Äôs not Trump‚Äôs fault.<END_COMMENT>
I would add- the story of Covid has eclipsed the fact of Covid.  Yes the virus can be hurtful.  But the story of Covid has caused widespread deception and depression.<END_COMMENT>

Listening to Biden and Trump debate on this was ridiculous. None of his ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù will do any better than anything Trump has done. 

Side note, a lot of good things were done to help Americans that Trump didn‚Äôt get credit for at all. The stimulus money getting sent out so quickly to everyone, pausing student loan payments and interest, the extra $600 on top of unemployment checks, hospitals aren‚Äôt struggling with PPE shortages anymore, we have plenty of tests, etc<END_COMMENT>

Exactly! They showed their true level of concern by promptly celebrating together in the streets when the media declared Biden the winner. After several months of protests that is.<END_COMMENT>
One thing to blame also is our health (obesity, hypertension).  In many countries the average age of death for COVID is above the average age of death overall (UK 82 covid, 81 population in general).   In the US its lower, like 71.  Probably due to our weight and diet problems.<END_COMMENT>

I remember the 'scientists' said that "if we handle the pandemic *perfectly* there will be 200,000 deaths...and if we handle it poorly, there will be 2,000,000".<END_COMMENT>
Not per capita.

Per capita, we‚Äôre right up alongside the UK, France, Spain, Italy, etc.

India, like Mexico, is likely bullshitting and wildly undercounting. In Mexico, Covid is either 200x deadlier than it is in the rest of the world, or they‚Äôre not testing for it. In India, people are 30x more likely to test positive for covid antibodies than to have been counted as having covid.<END_COMMENT>
>quote Fauci from March

I didn't quote Fauci, actually.

Either way - the projection stands. The goal posts were set end of March at 200,000 being a GOOD response. Now suddenly it's not good enough. As if Trump should have tried mandating masks. As if Trump should ignore the long term effects of serious long term harm to our economy.

Edit: for the person claiming that covid is only "20 times worse than the flu" you probably need to re-read the headline. The CDC was talking about hospital deaths. They're not talking about all covid infections. A small but **vital** distinction when talking about these stats.<END_COMMENT>

I mean the main difference is messaging. Trump is seen as soft on COVID. This is partially due to rhetoric and media, combined with inherent distrust because the sacred,  and omniscient ‚Äúscientists‚Äù flipped almost every two weeks, failed to condemn riots and protests while condemning the actually peaceful anti-lockdown protests weeks earlier, had some looney suggestions like no beach activity, or wear a mask while hiking. Also failed to condemn coumo and whitmers failures. A lot of people forgot about this near the election and a few follow up questions when interviewing Biden would have solved this, or some integrity but when orange man is bad, you can‚Äôt do that.<END_COMMENT>
I mean, they celebrated when Trump and Ben Carson contracted it and we're hoping they would die.<END_COMMENT>
THE CDC AND FAUCI have both said masks will not cure or stop the spread. Mayors and governors of deeply blue states have praised Trump and the federal government for getting them ventilators and supplies immediately. Trump does not deny science, but instead refuses to PLAY POLITICS with it, and tells the people to inform themselves.

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi has said in this same year that Trump is xenophobic for pinning this (rightfully) on the Chinese, and also successfully held up relief stimulus proceedings in the house, AT WHICH POINT she fought news anchors live on television.

Stay. Ratioed.<END_COMMENT>
Bro. There have been mask mandates country wide for fucking months. Blue states like Colorado have had them since July. And are having four to five time higher rates of infection than the peak in April.

>The turnout numbers are odd in some states, like Wisconsin, which hit 89 percent. Now, is that figure impossible? No. Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Kimberley Strassel did the math, but it‚Äôs highly improbable given the turnout rates in the surrounding areas. It would require 900,000 people showing up for same-day registrations. 

I've been looking for this number. Same-day registrations are one of the things supposed to be helping Biden's numbers but 900,000? Gimme a break, that never happened.

>Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in every major metro area around the country, save for Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia.

Biden did worse than a candidate Trump previously beat yet still won based on 4 hardcore Democrat cities and the votes they produced.

>Trump‚Äôs victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin were on target until, in the middle of the night, counting was arbitrarily halted.

This was always amazing to me, all these places just suddenly halted counting, all at about the same time with no real explanation for it. Then, they all just suddenly find enough votes to help Biden eke out a win.

This smells. It really smells. The question is not if there was fraud or not, there was. The question is was there enough fraud to overturn the election. Maybe there was.<END_COMMENT>

Clinton lost Omaha.  Biden won it.

Charleston County, SC ... Clinton won by 7.9 points, Biden won by 13.

Denver, CO ... Clinton won by 54.8 points, Biden won by 61.

Its truly sad to see how many Trump supporters have gone so far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories that its literally impossible for them to believe anything. Trump groomed them for the past 4 years that the only way he loses anything is because he‚Äôs a victim of being cheated. We all saw this in the 2015 primaries, we saw this in the lead up to the 2016 election, and now here we are. Trump is mentally incapable of accepting defeat because he‚Äôs been groomed his whole life that nobody likes a loser. The concept of losing is so alien to him and it‚Äôs something he can never accept. Textbook narcissism, and the folks here on this sub fail to see it or don‚Äôt want to see it and it‚Äôs doing substantial harm to our Democracy. I implore you all for the sake of the country you all claim to love please understand how damaging this is to our country.<END_COMMENT>

> On the left there is absolutely no election fraud

I'm a lefty, I'm sure there is some number of fraudulent ballots. Because there are some every election. But I highly doubt there is more than a few hundred cases nationally.

Have your recount, have your litigation, but try to live in reality a bit here too, widespread voter fraud in this country just doesn't exist.

Trump said the same thing about voter fraud when he lost the popular vote in 2016, we still don't have any evidence of those claims being true, now he's repeating them again?

> there is no substantial litigation taking place to change any states result.

Do you have a link to some of this substantial litigation? Most of it seems like, "please judge, they counted ballots that were received after election day," which plenty of states have done for years. NC counted ballots until the 12th, longer than GA, PA, and NV. Yet no Trump supporters are crying about NC being rigged?

> On the right every state with a close margin to Biden is about to have hundreds of thousands of ballots overturned.

Rudy Giuliani went on Crowder and literally said they expect the final number of fraudulent ballots to be like 600. Tucker Carlson even stated that whatever amount of fraud there is, it isn't enough to overturn the election.

I get that we likely differ greatly on policy, but at the moment, it seems like Trump supporters simply aren't living in reality.<END_COMMENT>

There is no fucking evidence. A TikTok of a dude burning sample ballots in a Walmart bag? "Totally dead" people voting (but any specific examples either did not actually vote or are actually alive)? I'm dismissing these stupid lawsuits because the Trump team is grasping at straws, as evidenced by the complete lack of evidence they bring to court, and how quickly the cases are thrown out. Show me one shred of credible evidence of fraud that can't be debunked with a quick Google search.<END_COMMENT>
It‚Äôs the courts who keep throwing cases out. If there‚Äôs such widespread fraud, why do some of the complaints boil down to subjective claims of rudeness on the part of poll workers? Like, why even make the frivolous claims if there‚Äôs actual meat on the bone?<END_COMMENT>
>The important take away, though, is that the left were quick to dismiss all of it, before even looking at evidence.

No, people were dismissing claims made by Trump because he was presenting no evidence while making those claims.<END_COMMENT>
It‚Äôs more because this was driven by Donald Trump and his claims that ‚Äòhe won easily‚Äô that people dismissed it. It‚Äôs because he did the same with Obama and the birther scam (he said he had evidence which turned out to be nonsense) and it was the same in 2016 when he claimed he won the popular vote (he set up a commission to investigate and it found nothing). The guy is just a poor loser.<END_COMMENT>
I‚Äôve followed all the cases of purported election fraud closely even several of the hearing that have posted the video recorded hearings. There is nothing substantial and even then they are being dismissed for lack of merit. I understand that this narrative will allow Trump to save face with his supporters, but his supporters seem extremely gullible in their support of an argument that has no factual basis. If there was widespread fraud, where‚Äôs the beef?<END_COMMENT>

He‚Äôs literally a child.<END_COMMENT>
If that were true then why is nothing holding up in court? 

You can‚Äôt say you have evidence but at the same time have it all thrown out even by Trump appointed judges. At that point it‚Äôs not evidence it‚Äôs just speculation.<END_COMMENT>
It‚Äôs a shotgun approach of nonsense.  Everything that has been brought forward in any official capacity HAS been debunked.  

And the rest? Well apparently they were so ludicrous that nobody even felt comfortable bringing them to court.

The problem with your ‚Äúprove all of these things wrong‚Äù approach is that it‚Äôs (a) misleading rhetoric in general and (b) far from defensible in court.  The burden of truth is on the accuser for a reason.

To paint this in a light that might resonate, I could make any number of salacious claims and then pretend I‚Äôm validated if you can‚Äôt immediately discredit them:

1) Prove the Russians DON‚ÄôT have a tape of Trump giving someone a golden shower 

2) Or that he‚Äôs NOT a sleeper agent installed by Russia to try to undermine our democracy

3) That Rudy didn‚Äôt fully fabricate the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù against Hunter Biden

You simply can‚Äôt fully disprove baseless accusations presented without evidence.  And as soon as you tried for any one, which would be extremely cumbersome to do, I could just throw in another one or modify it slightly or claim I think the sources you‚Äôre using are ‚Äúfake‚Äù or biased without any evidence of that either. 

It‚Äôs the equivalent of a rhetorical parlor trick meant to confuse people too distracted or stupid or gullible to understand how ridiculous the things you‚Äôre saying are.

It‚Äôs the rhetoric Trump uses, coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean that literally‚Äù walk backs, to be able to say anything he wants to elicit an emotional reaction from his base while never being on the hook to actually prove anything.  

And if he gets disproven later?  Well he‚Äôs already moved on to the next thing (see: birtherism when he finally admitted it was fake but then tried to claim Hillary came up with it).

It‚Äôs textbook.<END_COMMENT>

I expect nothing to pan out, because that's been the trend for a lot of these sorts of claims coming from Trump/his supporters for the last four years. It's not that I don't think their claims are legitimate, but you have to prove it, and you have to win in court and that honestly just doesn't happen.

As for this:
>  If there was widespread fraud, where‚Äôs the beef?

Honestly I think there is widespread election fraud at the software level, but I think it would be nearly impossible to prove. Everything is stacked against proving it. There's very little oversight, attempting to investigate is roadblocked immediately, at every level, and attempting to audit the vote is similarly roadblocked, or performed in a way that you may as well not have bothered.

The state of the election system in the US is deeply troubling, and while I hope Trump and his team have the evidence they claim to, I honestly doubt it. And I believe neither party is terribly interested in genuinely securing our elections, as both parties engage in manipulation.<END_COMMENT>

Oh! Yeah she seems pretty awesome.<END_COMMENT>
>Honestly I think there is widespread election fraud at the software level, but I think it would be nearly impossible to prove.

I have two genuine questions.

(1) If there was widespread, software-level fraud, wouldn't the Georgia hand-recount catch this? I understand conservatives and Trump have other problems with the Georgia hand-recount, largely with respect to signature verification of mail-in ballots. However, the recount and audit *will* verify whether or not the Dominion software counted the votes accurately.

In Georgia, where I live, you cast your vote on a touch screen and then your ballot is literally printed out. You verify your ballot print-out and then it is placed into a sealed box to be tabulated by the computer systems. The hand-recount involves counting the print-outs themselves, which every single voter had to inspect and sign off on before submitting.

(2) Assuming the results hold in the Georgia hand-recount, by what mechanism could the software have cheated?

I'm asking this because I really don't understand how there could have been software-level manipulation of votes in Georgia if a hand-recount demonstrates totals with no significant difference.<END_COMMENT>
Trump signed into power a cyber security team after the 2016 election... Those ARE his guys. They also agree there is no evidence of voter fraud.<END_COMMENT>
Honestly, if you think it's possible to commit fraude on this supposed scale 'at the software level' without producing credible evidence, you don't understand how to process works.<END_COMMENT>
So you believe their is widespread fraud at the software level? What particular aspect of the software do you purport to be compromised? 

Or is this more of a ‚Äúfaith-based‚Äù belief like religion where you can‚Äôt prove it‚Äôs real but you just believe because you trust the person who told you?<END_COMMENT>
Not usually. Usually there's some beef which prompts an investigation, and then the investigation determines whether that beef was the tip of an iceberg.

If there's no beef to start with, there's no reason to even have an investigation. It's like questioning everyone about whether they killed someone when there's nobody missing and no body. You normally need some trigger to cause an investigation, right?<END_COMMENT>
Yes...Donald J. Trump was named as a plaintiff along with others. All the filings and complaints are public, but let‚Äôs not check any facts because we have ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt believe that...any results are strange...I‚Äôm conservative and I support conservative values, but I also believe our country deserve a leader that can admit mistakes and change course when necessary.

The roles aren't reversed from 2000. In Bush v. Gore it all came down to a few hundred votes in a single state, well within the range that could be impacted by a recount. 

In 2020 Biden has a lead of tens/hundreds of thousands of votes across 6 or more states. Very different scenarios. 

Also, I haven't heard anything from the Biden camp suggesting that recounts shouldn't move forward, just that he should begin the transition based on the results of the election.<END_COMMENT>
It costs millions of dollars to recount. So depending on whose paying for that, we may have that to lose. Plus the time, space, effort, to recount. Will volunteers be doing the recount again as well?  

It also appears that Trump has been whispering in everyone's ear about *fraud, illegal votes, etc* since **the 2016 election** because why? Yet all that went away when he won? Is it so impossible that he can lose? It was a vlose race and Trump and Trump supporters had something to be proud of but now it's just getting so mucked up.

There's two outcomes, this is known before the race even starts. It's possible for either party to either win or lose, that's usually accepted. Idk where this idea came from that Trump just *could not* have lost.<END_COMMENT>
Well mainstream media isn't going to post news stories of fraud unless they have evidence. They are held to much higher standards than alternative news so the stories need to be validated. This isn't anything close to similar to the 2000 election. Gore and Bush were separated by 100s of votes in one state. Trump has lost by tens of thousands of votes in multiple states.

I'd just like to point out that even the mods on here are deleting news stories after they are proven false. Trust me, if actual evidence of election fraud is brought forth it will be covered by all major outlets. The issue is that just hasn't happened yet.<END_COMMENT>
It is completely unreasonable to believe in widespread fraude without evidence. And so far, we haven't seen anything remotely convincing.<END_COMMENT>

No time? If someone has the time/power/resources to use software to put their thumb on the scale, they have the same time/power/resources to invest in down-ballot races. 

Distributed across hundreds of thousands of precincts? So are the presidential votes‚Äîthey‚Äôre all routed through hundreds of thousands of precincts. 

There‚Äôs no coordination? No coordination at the local level but lots of coordination to tip the presidency‚ÄîI fail to see that as a viable reason. 

Cheating at all levels draws more eyes, more opportunity to have audits and recounts requested by multiple parties? This already is/has been going on at every level of our elections for centuries. They don‚Äôt make the headlines, but candidates in close congressional races demand recounts and audits routinely. 

More exposure? Someone‚Äôs going to miss that the Presidential election was rigged, but once they start rigging a congressional race *more* people will pay attention? I don‚Äôt buy that. 

I get the whole idea that giving wins to the GOP at local levels would seem to validate the executive results, if there were some massive software fraud conspiracy, but the scheme gets so elaborate its achievement begins to be implausible, bordering on the line of mental illness: the world around me is conspiring to keep Trump out of office, but it‚Äôs also working to pacify me from rebellion.

So what about people like my parents who voted for Obama in 2008 but voted Trump this year? Did they turn into racists?<END_COMMENT>
Ben shapiro talking about this was hilarious lol kiss my ass, barry!<END_COMMENT>
Because spending 8 years a president calling the American people racist wasn't enough.<END_COMMENT>
I saw him on '60 Minutes' tonight talking about Trump not accepting the results of the election. This coming from a man whose party still hasn't accepted the results of the 2016 election. He fits in perfectly with the rest of the hypocrites in his tribe.<END_COMMENT>
He always calls us racist. It‚Äôs the only card he wants to pull. 

Doesn‚Äôt want to admit that he was a shitty president.<END_COMMENT>

Calling someone who supports Trump a racist is a terrible stereotype and becoming the typical knee jerk statement from democrats.  It‚Äôs complete bullshit to make a blanket statement like that about anyone just because of their political views.<END_COMMENT>
Growing up we were always taught MLK Jr's philosophy on life. Judge others by content of their character, sadly the left seems to want to make it all about skin color now.<END_COMMENT>
Him running and then being re-elected wasn't enough to ignite the racist flames and keep him out 

It had to happen after his two terms 

Ya that makes sense 

Obama is the divisive one and yet he and his wife(or husband?)  continually play the blame game 

Can we go back 12 years and start fact checking Obama lol 

And guess what barrack I can disagree with you and not be a racist at the same time moron<END_COMMENT>
That Liar in Chief can't even accept intra-race racism. He needs to account for this first before pulling out a race card against hard working, peaceful Americans that stand up against woke policies, radical indoctrination in our schools, suppression of free thought in various media, restriction of personal rights and liberties, domestic terrorism, high unemployment, and a shitload of other issues that detract from being American.<END_COMMENT>
Sorry Obama, not all of us like bombing middle eastern schools<END_COMMENT>

Of course he did. He was The Great Divider.<END_COMMENT>
They always were! They just didn‚Äôt know it lol<END_COMMENT>

Bingo. That is me.<END_COMMENT>

I think the left would actually love it if Trump refused to leave office.  There would be ‚Äújustified‚Äù rioting and looting all over the country.<END_COMMENT>
What was your favorite things about Obama? Was it the cut to nasa funding? The record increases in health insurance cost? The slowest recession recovery in decades? Fast the furious? The NSA spying? Perhaps you mean the takeover and subsequent war with ISIS. Oh no it's gotta be the automatic classification of males as enemy combatants when killed by drones. 

Oooo no it's gotta be the red cross bombings or Benghazi attacks. Or are you more of a fan of his war on whistleblowers? How about his war on the press as he used the Espionage Act again and again against the press to silence them. Man he was such a "cool" well spoken president.<END_COMMENT>
Nah.. Trump awakened their racist foundations. He reminded them that their yellow skin was really white and that all of them who vote ‚Äúagainst their color‚Äù are doing it for the greatness of the Aryans.<END_COMMENT>

Not to play devils advocate but Trump refusing to leave the office if he got voted out would be unconstitutional<END_COMMENT>
Spooked by a socialist in the White House is more like it<END_COMMENT>
You‚Äôre right, they‚Äôre are. To assume most care though is disingenuous and dangerous to base policy on the assumption everyone is.<END_COMMENT>
Makes a ton of sense. See, i married a black woman, have a biracial son, but Trump brought out the true racist nature that i never knew was inherent in my DNA!<END_COMMENT>
The obamas have said a shit ton of racist shit the last couple weeks. That whole family is fucking trash.<END_COMMENT>
He's challenging the results, he has a right to do that and this isn't the first time this had happened in our history. Nothing's been certified yet and won't be until December 12 or so? Plus he'll stay in office until January 20th.

Calm down and let the process play out. If he still refuses to concede, then you have every right to freak out and I'll be right there with you.

Until then, calm down....<END_COMMENT>
My exact thoughts every time I hear someone call Trump a fascist and all of his supporters racists<END_COMMENT>

I‚Äôm going to feel like an idiot either way:

Five years of engineering school landed me a pretty solid job and I‚Äôve been paying it down considerably since I graduated.

1. They‚Äôll tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo rich‚Äù for the program since I have a real job and give the ‚Äúfree money‚Äù to the guy who got an underwater basket-weaving degree while I pay for it through taxes and inflation. So I‚Äôll be stuck paying my loans AND everyone else‚Äôs.

2. On the off chance I‚Äôm actually included, I‚Äôll feel like an idiot for doing what‚Äôs right and actually paying down $1000 a month for the last three years when it gets thrown away anyways.

Either way the real answer is addressing the cost of these public schools.  I averaged 21 credit hours per semester for 5 years to graduate in engineering. To be a ‚Äúwell rounded student‚Äù (actually to make the uni‚Äôs bottom line) I was forced to take 3 climate change classes, a gender studies class, a music class (despite a decade of classical training) and a whole bunch of other fluff that cost me 10‚Äôs of thousands of dollars (Some of which was loans).

On top of that the engineering President made 980,000 a year and I never even met him.  He left to be the dean of a separate university at the end of my 3rd year.  Over the next two years, literally nothing changed and things possibly even got better under the direction of an interim professor who made no additional salary while they looked for a new overpriced President. And that was just one of many schools at the university.<END_COMMENT>

When the history books are written, this chapter will be titled "Pandemic Politics." We've embraced a sort of bizarro world in which we are faced with a pretty clear public health problem, and instead of solving it we've decided to use it as a political platform.  
Both parties have run so far from the actual common-sense solutions to this problem, that the bases of each party are now stuck in a swamp of misinformation and partisan pseudo-science.

We now have "Republican" and "Democrat" scientists. Let that sink in. 

I see a lot of complaining by "conservatives" that Democrats want to "cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas." And I see an equal amount of "liberals" claiming that Republicans are trying to actively kill their constituents (I've even seen "liberals" claiming some Republican lawmakers are murdering American citizens for political gain). Both of these notions are incorrect and laughable.

Here is my personal (and probably equally biased) opinion on the new coronavirus: 

1. It's real. And it's potentially deadly to a non-insignificant percentage of our adult population. The numbers clearly suggest it will not wipe out the human race, but it could easily kill adults who would otherwise live. 
2. I do not want to contract a serious case of the coronavirus. I do not want to be hospitalized or be intubated. 
3. Long-term hospitalizations are a much better metric of measuring the virus' severity than death counts or case numbers. It appears that as ICUs approach capacity, mortality rates rise. Not really a big surprise there - obviously a lower doctor-per-patient ratio will lead to worse healthcare.
4. Individual states should be allowed to issue their own mandates without interference from the federal government. Anything else is unconstitutional. The caveat here should be that states must disclose the data behind their decisions. There's no reason why Idaho and New Jersey should have identical guidelines. 
5. Science is not static. We've learned so much in a very short amount of time about the new coronavirus. I'm willing to listen to new information whether or not that fits my "political agenda." 
6. The common sense crowd of scientists and doctors have never proposed restrictions as means to end the virus. The most important role of our coronavirus response has always been to relieve the pressure on our hospital system (particularly the ERs and ICUs). When those beds are filled, it drives up not only the mortality rate for CoVID cases but for non-CoVID cases. What happens to heart-attack victims, appendicitis patients, or even trauma patients when the hospital is full? 

Maybe these views peg me as a "RINO" or as a "lower case" conservative, but I don't really give a shit. I think most Americans would much prefer a more state-centric and science based approach to handling this issue than has currently been put forth.<END_COMMENT>

Nope.

I‚Äôm actually impressed how long it took people to become maskholes who freak out over someone not wearing one. Suddenly a piece of cloth became necessary without any scientific evidence that they stop the spread of a microscopic organism that‚Äôs airborne. 

NPCs everywhere. 

If you want a preview of the future of this nation, just reflect back on how looting and rioting were condoned and deemed necessary while going out to the beach was an arrest-able offense. 

How people can celebrate an election result en masse but can‚Äôt go attend church services.

What do you mean? 

As I understand it, the standard at play here is: 

**If you impose rules on other people because they are allegedly necessary, then you should also follow the same rules.**

That seems like a very reasonable standard to me. 

As to this being reported for several days, it merits that attention in my opinion (but I also happen to believe that politicians serve us, rather than rule us, so perhaps that is incompatible with some views of government). 

When politicians claim that restricting interactions between free humans is necessary, I expect that the politicians genuinely believe that it is in fact literally necessary - because if it is not, then they are absolutely wrong to impose such restrictions. 

This has nothing to do with whether she (or other politicians like Newsom) got caught or responded to public opinion afterwards. 

The issue is that her intention to host the dinner shows that she does NOT believe that such restrictions are necessary - if you genuinely believe that X poses a significant, potentially deadly threat to society, *you obviously don‚Äôt even consider doing X.*<END_COMMENT>

As someone who lived through the Clinton gov't and the PC culture of the 90s, this is a real deja vue moment. 

Ironically, things have never been better for minorities than they are now, and they're always getting better. True, there is still a significant amount of disparity, but that's for reasons that require generational changes. Wealthier minorities still have a lot of social and economic ties to communities that are riddled with problems, and until they can have a generation grow up without those ties then they're gonna be held back by them.

It's mostly individuals acting racist now, and it turns out assholes always are going to exist. If they keep painting every white person as an enemy because of that, though, well that's what you call a "Self fulfilling prophecy". Which is fucking sad, because 99% of people don't want to hate anyone.

Edit: Lol. Got in before the flair lockdown but now I can't respond anymore.<END_COMMENT>
I tried to make the point on r/politics that there needs to be some examination of why 70m+ people voted for Trump beyond "white supremacy" but was voted into oblivion.

I went to school in the 1970s. Team Teaching was the fad for several years. They even built a school with no class rooms to prove the system worked. The idea was to group the kids into units and teachers would move through the throng in "teams." It was bedlam. No one was called out for this. No one was reprimand and the students lost two years of education. The building was repurposed and the progressives skipped off to their next failure. This is just one small example.

*granted i hope trump wins... 

but to throw out all the ballots  giving trump the victory seems like it undermines the system in the opposite way...   

the left will go nuts and claim it was stolen from them.. (which i understand the reason for,  i would be upset if this happened to trump)

i understand that there was likely mass cheating and nonsense going on...

basically i don't want trump to win on a technicallity or anything..
 i want the american people (right and left) to see the true acturate results as they are...<END_COMMENT>
I posted this in a different thread but want to re-iterate. I am a Democrat and agree that we should ensure that elections are fair, and that Trump absolutely has the right to request recounts and to investigate allegations of fraud. Most Democrats, and people in general, agree with this.

\*\*\*But that's not what is happening here\*\*\*

There is a huge difference between calmly requesting these things to be done, and automatically making claims (or shall I say yelling and shouting in ALL CAPS on Twitter) that Democrats "rigged" the election, that any possible cases of tampering with ballots are from Democrats, that Democrats are cheaters and liars, that Trump WON the election (by a lot), that anyone that votes against him is anti Christian and anti American (as if we don't have a democracy and people don't have the right to vote for anyone but him), retweeting conspiracy theories spread by random anonymous people on social media, going on angry rampages on Twitter, attacking Fox News for reporting on the election in a way he doesn't like.... I could go on and on.

Trump and his team are making the assumption that **anywhere Trump won, there is no need to review the voting process or question anything**, but only to do this in areas where he lost. **Let's make it clear, none of these lawsuits would be happening if Trump won this election.**

Selectively identifying allegations only in the areas where Trump lost is not the equivalent of trying to ensure the integrity of the overall voting process. I'm sure for any one Democrat that did something wrong, there is likely a Republican that did something similar, but there is no acknowledgment of this of course. It's a very biased, one sided investigation with the goal of trying to get Trump enough votes to win, not to ensure fairness in the election process!!

Because when you are trying to ensure fairness, you go in to the investigation knowing that the outcome could go either way (in Trump's favor or in Bidens favor). You don't come to the conclusion first and then try to seek out evidence. Trump already had the outcome laid out in his mind BEFORE investigating anything.

There is a normal way and a psychotic way to go about verifying/confirming election votes. Trump is clearly in the latter category. THAT is the problem.<END_COMMENT>
A similar lawsuit by the Trump campaign was already thrown out a few days ago: [https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/wayne-circuit-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-city-of-detroit-alleging-election-fraud](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/wayne-circuit-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-city-of-detroit-alleging-election-fraud)

&#x200B;

None of the claims they make in the case (on page 10) have any corroborating evidence. Their "evidence" section is simply references to laws that say the votes would be invalid **if** what they alleged happened actually happened. But they need to prove with "clear and convincing" evidence (not beyond a reasonable doubt since this isn't a criminal trial) that what they claim occured did occur, and they don't. I don't see how this won't end up like the many other lawsuits that were swiftly dismissed last week.<END_COMMENT>

If the ballots weren't legal to count or cast then they should be thrown out; that would provide the true accurate results. Plain and simple.

It's not winning on a technicality, it's winning despite either someone's unintentional fuck up or a deliberate attempt to cheat.

P.S. The left will never see the election of someone they disagree with as legitimate. Look at the 2016 election, GA governor election with Stacy Abrams.<END_COMMENT>

It's been a week and most have been thrown out for lack of evidence or witnesses

Here is just Michigan for three different cases:

* "Chief Judge Timothy M. Kenny denied the petition, finding the ‚Äú[p]laintiffs‚Äô interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible."[34] The judge stated that the plaintiffs did not properly understand the "TCF absent ballot tabulation process" because they failed to attend a familiarization session on October 29."

* "The judge also noted the official complaint did not state "why", "when, where, or by whom" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan"<END_COMMENT>

What does that have to do with throwing out invalid ballots? There not just throwing out random ones.

do you think it's a reasonable position that millions of people voted illegally? 

Clearly those people voted and thought that the way they were voting was legal.

There really isn't any evidence of illegal voting attached to the complaint. Repeating the remote possibility of illegal voting is not evidence.  Like I said, this suit just repeats the hearsay of the other lawsuits already dismissed.  The burden of proof is a lot higher in the court than social media.<END_COMMENT>
There is zero evidence of widespread fraud. The only misinformation is coming from conservative news outlets spreading this garbage.

Honestly idk if I would really want Trump again in 2024. He had good policies so it would be cool if he continued to work with the Republicans to shape the party but I think we need some new blood with a less crass/rude demeanor but it will all depend on who steps up when we get there.<END_COMMENT>

So your understanding of fair elections is to block states from certifying results by bombarding courts with lawsuits. And you don‚Äôt even care if lawsuits are legit or baseless, you just expect it to take long enough so Congress have to decide the matter. You do realize that it creates the precedent and every presidential election forward would be decided by Congress?<END_COMMENT>
Are you somehow being denied the same ability to mail your ballot in as the other people in your state who were given that option?<END_COMMENT>
Because mail in ballots have been done since the civil war and have always been done the same basic way.

Trusting the electoral system and fine tuning it when necessary *between* elections and not *during* elections is how the system is kept in check without guaranteeing some biased decision making.<END_COMMENT>

#Michigan:

* Donald J. Trump for President v. Benson (Michigan State Court) **Dismissed**

>The judge also noted the official complaint did not state "why", "when, where, or by whom" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan

* Donald J. Trump for President v. Benson (Federal Court) **Ongoing** (but unlikely)

>On November 11, the Trump campaign filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. The campaign repeated allegations in Constantino v. Detroit and provided hundreds of pages of affidavits from poll challengers, seeking to block Michigan's certification of the vote.

(Constantino v. Detroit was throw out,  finding the ‚Äú[p]laintiffs‚Äô interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible." The judge stated that the plaintiffs did not properly understand the "TCF absent ballot tabulation process" because they failed to attend a familiarization session on October 29")

#Pennsylvania:


* Donald J Trump for President, Inc v. Kathy Boockvar and County Boards of Elections **Ruled in Trump's favor(kind of)**

> Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who told voters they had until November 12 to provide proof of identification in order for their ballots to be counted, three days past the deadline set by state law. The judge ruled that ballots are not to be counted if identification has not been shown by November 9. **This ruling affected a small number of ballots that were not included in the vote count.**

Donald J Trump for President, Inc v. Philadelphia County Board of Elections **Settled but doesn't affect votes**

Donald J. Trump for President v. Montgomery County Board of Elections **Dismissed**

>On Friday, Judge Haaz denied the petition to disqualify the ballots. ‚ÄúVoters should not be disenfranchised by reasonably relying upon voting instructions provided by election officials which are consistent with the Election Code,‚Äù he wrote.

Donald J. Trump for President v. Boockvar **Withdrawn**

>The campaign challenged the results of the election, alleging and asked the court to prohibit the certification of results. The Ohio-based Porter Wright Morris & Arthur law firm that represented the Trump campaign withdrew from this case on November 13.

#Arizona

Donald J. Trump for President v. Hobbs **Withdrawn**

>During the hearing, the lawyer for the Trump campaign, Kory Langhofer, stated that the plaintiffs were "not alleging fraud" or "that anyone is stealing the election", but were disputing "good faith errors." This contradicted Trump's claim of fraud and illegitimate victories in multiple states.[73]

>On November 13, the lawsuit regarding presidential ballots was dropped, after it became evident that the number of votes potentially to be contested (191) would not overcome Biden's margin of victory in the state (11,414 at the time, with 10,315 uncounted).<END_COMMENT>

For real guy how do you make that bizzare thought process work? Trump and his lawyers have been claiming fraud for a few weeks now. 
Yet no evidence has been presented that anybody finds credible. No judge has found any of it credible.

A Republican City Commissioner in Pennsylvania is getting death threats for being part of the "DNC voter fraud scheme". This stupid conspiracy endorsed by Trump is becoming dangerous.

Mate you‚Äôve got to be smarter than this honestly. There is no evidence. No judge. No Republican governor **anywhere** and no election official has said anything other than this is baseless fantasy garbage. 

And frankly I‚Äôm tired of hearing all of you just change the music to fit your goals. 

First it was going to be ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù on Monday after the election was called on the weekend. 

That was 7 days ago and nothing has occurred eacsot these baseless absolutely COMICAL lawsuits being thrown out for the garbage dumpster fire they are. 

I honest to god do not get how somebody gets to a point in there life where every single person of credibility has already stated **LOUDLY** that there was nothing wrong or surprising about this election. 

The only idiot who keeps claiming otherwise is Donald trump. Because he **lost** and he‚Äôd like not to have lost. So instead he relies on his army of sycophants to keep denying reality. 

He lost. And literally everybody of actual credibility has already put this to bed. 

What I find gross is come Jan 20 when this is over and still no real evidence has been presented. Ruled upon or gone anywhere. 
All of you will just make up some other fantasy reason ‚Äúbut what about the miss filed paperwork we XYZ blah blah‚Äù

Sorry for the massive rant but for real dude. This stuff has been booted out of court in so many states. Isn‚Äôt it obvious at this point?????

Trump endorsing the kenya conspiracy is horrible and it's sad Republicans tolerated it. Trump shitting on McCain is pathetic and is the reason he lost Arizona. Not voter fraud cases that are hyped up in the media but nothing in court.

The US should probably have 100 stealth bombers (B-21 Raiders) and 200 non-stealth bombers.  Stealth bombers are great for sneaking up on an enemy, but tend to be costly to fly and require a lot of maintenance.  The non-stealth bombers should focus on long range and high availability.

A non-stealth bomber can be loaded with cruise missiles that have a range that exceeds that of air defence coverage.  There are many enemies such as the Taliban or ISIS who require air strikes, but don‚Äôt have air defence systems.

I‚Äôm thinking of a subsonic bomber which is basically a B-52 with all of the improvements to materials and engine technology made over the last half century.  It could also be sold to foreign nations because it wouldn‚Äôt have anything too secret.

There is way too much focus on fighter aircraft.  Fighter aircraft do certainly have a prominent role to play, but they are not the only type of aircraft needed.<END_COMMENT>

OP seems to be omitting the part where the US administration eliminated the pandemic response team in DHS, eliminated the CDC infectious disease resource working in China, cast aside the pandemic response playbook left by the prior administration(s), and ignored clear warnings about Covid in the PDB back in January.

Further, while the US is fucking around with self-destructive tariffs & ruining TPP, China just signed the biggest trade pact in the world with countries that used to be in our sphere of influence.  Twenty years from now, this isolationism and anti-science sentiment in the US will leave us poor and fallen behind, leaving china to run the world in our absence.<END_COMMENT>

I know people who currently live in China, they actually do seem to have the virus under control. One of the benefits of a terrifying dictatorship - they can force the citizens to lock down.<END_COMMENT>

China instituted a draconian level lock down early on that lasted for several months.

US completely ignored it calling it fake news and hosting covid parties.

There was a fucking huge difference in government responses<END_COMMENT>
I think it funny everyone is complaining how China lied. Yes, they wasn't transparent at first. But, they give reasonable amount of time for the world to prepare while they are locking down their cities. Meaning other country should be using their lockdown period to stock up more equipment and any possible pandemic SOP. Country like Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Australia have been doing great in such preparations. US putting all the blame to China is adsurb because they have month ahead of the countries I listed in preparation. Yet they just stand there like a moron waiting for the virus to hit their shore. After that they start to panic due to the lack of equipment and then convinently blamed China for it. TRUMP is really a terrible manager.<END_COMMENT>

I think he could have done better.  We caught it early, but wasted time when we could have prepared so much better.  FFS, Reddit knew something was happening in China as early as December and that the government was covering it up.  We saw videos of doctors in ICU‚Äôs.  The Woodward call even shows he knew it was more deadly than the flu and weeks went by before we did anything about it.

His message also could have been so much better on it.  Instead of undermining the science, he could have relied on it, and when his response garnered criticism, he could have easily just said he relied on the recommendations of the worlds leading infectious disease expert.  But he called it a hoax and said it would be gone by April.  

There is also no reason for him to have rejected masks the way that he did.  The messaging on that should have been that masks are not 100% effective, but with enough precautions in place, we can reduce the rate of transmission, reopen the economy, blah blah blah. 

Whoever was advising him on this really shit the bed.<END_COMMENT>
Trump handled it TERRIBLY. The only good idea that he had was the travel ban, and that was too little, too late. He had intel back in November 2019 about the virus and didn‚Äôt lift a finger to do anything about it.

I get that people here like his politics, and they don‚Äôt like his opponents‚Äô, but like he has been absolutely terrible at his job of managing our country & government.

Edit: fixed 2019 (originally 2029)<END_COMMENT>
He did essentially nothing. So yes, he handled it badly.<END_COMMENT>
Yes

Even here in Canada we're doing better, and we don't have much more measures in place than America. A big thing looking in on the states is the existance of Anti-maskers, something that doesn't really exist in urban/suburban Ontario where I live. Our cases are mainly coming from multi-family households, LTC outbreaks or people intentionally ignoring public health guidelines. In America, at least from an outsider, it just looks like the general view on Covid is "sure, I'll wear a mask when I have to, but overall I'm just waiting for a vaccine/herd immunity". Which, while understandable, is very destructive.<END_COMMENT>
I think Trump, policy wise, did fine. A lot of control over this isn‚Äôt a federal matter. The support was there for the states when it was needed.,

Optically, he sucked. Handing it to Pence and walking away was not good. I wanted a Bush with a megaphone moment for Trump .. instead I got quiet Pence being harassed by press hacks.<END_COMMENT>
He should've never fired and disbanded the pandemic response team either. At most he should've told the country to listen to the experts, doctors and scientists.<END_COMMENT>
Amen. While it was still in China it was their responsibility but at soon as it reached the US it became our governments responsibility to educate and protect its people. Trump did neither and went out of his way to spread misinformation and encourage dangerous behavior.<END_COMMENT>
While China‚Äôs borderline terroristic behavior does not excuse poor handling of the situation, poor handling of the situation does not excuse China‚Äôs borderline terroristic behavior.

China knew about the virus and had seen it spread between people, but violently made sure word didn‚Äôt escape because they didn‚Äôt want to interrupt the massive travel oriented around the Chinese New Year that accelerated the pandemic dramatically. They then weaponized WHO for political purposes (excluding Taiwan, actively spreading known disinformation that there was no human to human spread, etc.), handcuffing global pandemic responses until a responsible nation did the research themselves. They then had the audacity to blame the US for the pandemic and claim that we ignored their warnings. Meanwhile, they were doing things like reselling free health equipment to affected countries for a profit (in one instance the same country, Italy, who gave the equipment in the first place), repressing Hong Kong, genociding Uighurs (not that that was new), reopening wet markets, spreading both panic about the virus and allegations of anti-Chinese racism through social media bots, and mocking the rest of the world.

My biggest complaint about the Trump administration is that he wasn‚Äôt hard enough on China. We didn‚Äôt recognize Taiwan. We didn‚Äôt pay businesses‚Äô leaving costs. We didn‚Äôt tightly sanction China nor put an insurmountable tariff on Chinese imports, even non-essential ones. We didn‚Äôt sue in an international court to legitimize canceling treasury bonds. What did he do? Forced them to sell TikTok‚Äôs American operations and criticized a little bit for political posturing?<END_COMMENT>
Many Americans stand with Taiwan. We just need to recognize that the CCP is evil.<END_COMMENT>
Absolutely! Zero faith in that organization.<END_COMMENT>
China lied, and it's been a whole year. 

If you have a one night stand and catch chlamydia, and the chick tells you a few weeks later, do you curse the chick who gave it to you and call it a day, or do you also go to the doctor for some antibiotics?

If you opt for not going to the doctor, then your dick falling off is entirely on you. It's not her fault.

The soon 250k deaths is not China's fault alone. You can't just push away responsibility like a child. At a certain point it's *your* reality and *you* have to take responsibility. And in this case "you" is the sitting administration, headed by Trump. It's Trump making your dick fall off, Trump and Xi.<END_COMMENT>

They're far from trustworthy, but Japan, South Korea, and actually most East and South Asian nations have been handling this very well.  Their culture isn't so individualized, and they had already normalized mask wearing well before this. Coupled with China's ability to clamp down, even going as far as locking people in their apartments, it's plausible for their numbers to be what they claim.<END_COMMENT>
Yup, they've had in well under control since April actually. When I went (following 3 weeks quarantine), COVID had become such a non issue most people weren't even wearing masks.

But that's because their government tracks where and when everyone is. If one person gets infected and you were in the same city a day ago, you're forced into house quarantine. And they'll know if you're quarantine or not. Pretty scary stuff but effective for virus control.<END_COMMENT>
We had a travel ban on China and anyone that had been in China recently within the first few weeks of January, that‚Äôs not ignoring it.

And it worked, COVID didn‚Äôt come to the US through China, it went from China to Europe and then the US.<END_COMMENT>
You pretend that you do<END_COMMENT>
Trump did everything in his power to downplay the virus and cast doubt on scientists who call for more precautions. Obama left him a damn manual and a pandemic response team, which he dismantled because the sole purpose he became president was to destroy Obama's legacy.

So no, this is solely the fault of Trump.<END_COMMENT>

No. China may have originated the issue, but Trump has been more concerned with his own election this entire year than convincing US people of the dangers of the virus / wear a mask in public.  To be frank, I don't think he has a moral compass and is unfit to run this country.<END_COMMENT>

It wasn't flip flipping, it was adjusting recommendations as new information was discovered. That's how these things work. Trump did about the worst thing possible in demonizing some medical professionals while giving platform to quackpots that contradicted what was being reported. I honestly think his handling of this whole thing cost him a lot of votes from centrists. This should never have been a politicized thing, and agreeing with Dems about the severity would have shown he was more concerned with the well being of individuals than playing party politics. Bad stuff happens during every presidency. It's how it is handled that makes or breaks a leader.<END_COMMENT>
The US has done horribly compared to other western nations and developed countries. Terrible leadership and another shining example why Donald Trump is a terrible president and con artist.<END_COMMENT>
The China travel ban didn‚Äôt stop people from coming back from China, it only stopped Chinese from coming in from China. Americans could still fly to China, walk around, sample the wet meat markets, fly back to the US without issue.  Each day 30 planes from China were landing an Los Angeles, 30 in San Francisco, and 25 in New York. So yes, ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù the virus got here.<END_COMMENT>
Do you think him saying that It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem may have caused his supporters to not wear a protective mask, that inevitably furthered the spread at a quicker pace?<END_COMMENT>
Trump could‚Äôve done a lot better on messaging and setting an example with the public. This, in my opinion, is one of his biggest failures in handling the pandemic. Take masks for instance. He necessarily politicized wearing them and set a terrible example by not immediately wearing one as soon as the CDC recommended them. 

There‚Äôs also the fact that he knew back in February how deadly covid is but didn‚Äôt publicly acknowledge the threat and instead acted like it was going away. Honestly, this absolutely could‚Äôve been handled better at the federal level.<END_COMMENT>
The fact that I had to have a civil discussion with a family member yesterday about why I wear a mask is wild. 

They said masks aren‚Äôt necessary. 

I asked what‚Äôs the worst that happens if I wear a mask? 

I asked what agenda do bipartisan medical professionals have to lie about masks being beneficial. 

I hate that masks became a political issue. That message should have been a ‚ÄúAmericans together regardless of party need to fight this together‚Äù<END_COMMENT>
There is a lot to unpack here. 

Trump was briefed about the virus in December, some world leaders a but after. All in all they decided to follow different paths with the help of their respective medical experts. Some focused on herd immunity (Sweden) some focused on lockdowns (new Zealand) and some focused on.....just not enough....China has royally screwed the world when it comes to this pandemic and we better sure as shit hold their ass to the fire when this is over (though I'm sure it won't get done). But, in case studies that will occur in the years to come and the individual national responses that started I think we will look at the many countries in the developed world and see that the US has been near the worst. Maybe not the worst because France and Italy among a few others where surely pretty terrible but in the top 5 for the worst national responses. 

Now I don't say all this to crucify the country or really blame any sitting president as who knows if Biden or Bush or Obama would have done it any better because there is such political polarizations of every damn topic out there it probably would have made no damn difference....

And that is the problem....<END_COMMENT>

March 9th trump tweeted claiming that covid is less dangerous than the flu, significantly less dangerous. He told Bob Woodward in February it was dangerous. When asked about it he said that he downplayed it in order to prevent panic. You can prevent panic for a category 5 hurricane by calling it a tropical storm, that doesn't change the fact it is a lie. IF the number of lives lost due to china's lies are significant or bad, which is implied by the title, then that same claim should also be applied to Donald Trump. 

Don't get me wrong, Trump did some things right with respect to the virus, namely shutting down travel with china. But he didn't tell the american people how serious it was until it was too late. Had Trump been supportive and an example of wearing masks WITHOUT mandates, alot of his supporters would have worn them without the need for mandates, and that would have saved lives.<END_COMMENT>
 [He knew the virus was more dangerous than he let on.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-book-idUSKBN2602TR) ([Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4U4XwS2Nv4))He  repeatedly said it was just like the flu and that it would "magically  disappear" when the warm weather started. Laughed and mocked people who  follow CDC and WHO guidelines. Told people that it was nothing to worry  about. Not to mention the disbanding of the pandemic response team Obama  had left him without replacing it. And then lying to the press saying  he had no idea it existed or that it was dismantled saying it must have  been someone else on his team who dismantled it.

Downplaying  it is one thing, but straight up lying about it being serious is  another. any other president would have said something along the lines  of "We are facing a global threat, but we the American people are strong  and we will get through this. We have a team of medical experts  analyzing the problem as I speak coming working out a plan to combat  this enemy."

Something along these  lines would show that the president is taking the problem seriously and  will do all in their power to keep America safe, this in turn keeps  people calm and assured that things wont get too bad. Instead Trump  acted like it was no big deal while America watched the virus spread  like wild fire in every single country it touched down in before it got  to us. With no assurance of a plan to deal with it, and no sign of the  President taking it seriously people panicked, buying everything in mass  creating massive shortages everywhere.

By  downplaying it to such a degree that he did, to his base who lets be  honest treat every word that comes out of his mouth as if it comes  straight from the Bible, in straight opposition of what medical experts  around the world said and say. A large chunk of his base started to  believe it was a hoax, a conspiracy by Democrats to hurt his reelection  chances, and still believe that to this day. So these people who believe  that ignore all guide lines and further spread it and keep the virus  going.

 Over 246k Americans are dead because Trump lied from the beginning about  how dangerous the virus is to try and keep people carrying on like  nothing is wrong.<END_COMMENT>
