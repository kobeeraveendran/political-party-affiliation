"Russia rigged the election" - Dems, 2016"there's no way this election was rigged" - Dems, 2020"if there's nothing to hide, let the process happen" - Dems, 2016-2019"if there's nothing to hide, let the process happen" - Republicans, 2020-20sHuT uP anD ConCEdE tHe ElECtiONValidation of the election is part of the election process. Are we not allowed to ask questions? We had to put up with years of bitching about Russia. There was a lot less proof of "Russian Meddling" than there is about Voter Fraud. But no, we're expected to concede the day after. The day after the most irregular election of all time. The media tells us that the mail in process has been used for years. Yeah, with a few votes. Not 10's of millions. How stupid do they think we are? When we get close to the truth, they cry louder. Make them scream.
https://hereistheevidence.com/#If you are NOT a Republican and you are coming here to insist that we just IGNORE allegations of voter irregularity... go away.Just go away.You have your own subreddits where you can circlejerk to Russian collusion and call us all Russian bots WHILE ALSO insisting that we are all totally deluded to be concerned about election fraud.This is our sub.  We want to discuss what is of interest to us... and we should be able to without you insisting that we follow YOUR narrative.You are all completely unable to put away your demagoguery and consider that if the election results had been reversed and these claims of irregularity were out there, you wouldn't be happy to just investigate.  You'd demand a NEW election.  You know damned well that Biden had a legal team ready to challenge results and that Hillary told HIM not to concede "under any circumstances."And more than this, if the election had gone to Trump and there were allegations of vote switching, vote fraud, possible vote counting software sabotage...etc... it would be literally#ALL YOU WERE TALKING ABOUTIn between rioting and burning the country down to the ground.
Hey not trying to circlejerk and just asking an honest question. The Russian interference with the 2016 election was happening before the vote, isn't that what democrats are claiming? That it wasn't the machines or extra votes or whatever but pretty much propaganda that was going on. That's clearly different to what republicans are claiming now, don't you think so?
The fact that they're threatening Ellis indicates her and her team are on to something.

LOL. It's literally a live stream of a court hearing
Genuine question. Isn't Rudy the legal team lead? Asking because you said Ellis's team
It's maddening to watch these snakes act as if nothing happened. This was the most transparent election fraud I've ever seen. Certainly the largest in history.

Are you aware it was in a hotel and not a official hearing?
Not evidence in a legal sense, no. But on the same token, would you agree the overwhelming amount of people willing to sign affidavits (and go to prison if they lie under oath) is a little concerning?
I don't think you know what the word "concede" means.
I would if any of these affidavits said point blank I witnessed fraud. None of them do, read them yourself. Even exhibit 107 in Sidneys latest dump is a man talking about shit that happened a year ago and did not witness anything on Election Day. And I also remind you dozens of woman have written and affirmed affidavits that they were sexually assaulted by president Trump, is that evidence you give the same weight?
Do you recognize the hearing was not official? And that witness testimony with nothing backing is not evidence?
I have a question? Do you believe Brian Kemp is involved in a scheme to flip votes from trump to Biden?
I served in the Army, as a soldier I swear to keep my promise.
MSM only said it was debunked to make their viewers and themselves feel better.
Funny how it was never submitted as evidence.
At this point it's basically become a pissing contest between both sides. "Oh we have affidavits, oh we have this, but this video doesn't show this, and there was more footage that he didn't present from that night as well". Point of the matter is - at this point, it doesn't matter. Not one bit. Argue about what this video shows or doesn't show all you want, even IF Trump managed to get Georgia turned, he's still behind. Period. It won't make a lick of difference in the overall election. If for no other reason, than there simply isn't. Any. Time. Left. Electorals are going to cast their votes in a week. As well, the safe harbor established under the Electoral Count Act of 1887 is December 8th. TOMORROW. All of the states that have been certified at this point, which CANNOT be contested after this date, also still puts Biden squarely in the Presidential shoes. California already certified too. So whether this evidence shows what it was claimed to show, whether it was debunked at all, this whole pissing contest of back and forth over Georgia DOES. NOT. MATTER.
when they get to 11:00, the lower two videos stop running where the witnesses were.
I'm pretty sure that being pretty sure isn't gonna do jack-all when it goes to court.
Even if it doesn't change the outcome of the election don't the American People at least deserve to know if they got scammed? I know that whenever I get screwed I at least like to know who is screwing me so I can watch them more closely in the future.
And nobody has been able to explain why the videos are presented that way...
Pretty sure thats not up to you to decide.
Is it though? Most of the time I hear this being regurgitated on various social media, most of the people are chanting Trump 2020 and all along with it, as if they somehow believe Georgia is the new Florida and it's somehow the year 2000 again. And even then, even IF Georgia itself had fraud occur, that doesn't mean there was mass election fraud. Georgia is one state. Never mind that, as of now, there have been THREE full recounts in Georgia. The results have not changed. Leave the horse alone, it's beyond dead.
Of course she did, Pelosi is about as corrupt as they come
Prove it in court or stop feeding the echo chamber
The proof will arrive any minute now. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaany minute now.
^^ this :) ... I want to see the court filing that shows a lawyer putting his job on the line claiming this, otherwise I feel my time is getting wasted :/
There will be every year going forward.
Sorry I'm a little out of the loop, but how is (2) fraud? Thanks
Which official source considers voting by mail as non legitimate and with what cause?
>  What more do you need?due process
Wow a whole binder? Why didn't you say so. You have to present it in a court of law and win your case. You can't just talk about your feelings in a conference room at a Best Western.
Not saying there isn't fraud, but what he showed, and what we all actually saw, was a binder ... Can't claim we knew what was in it, and if the courts think it's good enough, they will move on it for sure :)
Socialist scare tactics are used for exactly that, to keep us scared. I find peace knowing that extreme leftists do not approve of the Democratic Party, and that the DNC appears to take their votes for granted, just like most of their voting demographics.
Youd be surprised how many idiots fall for the "free stuff" lieEdit: a socialist downvoted this comment
im so proud of you honestly. Keep standing up for what you believe in. It will get you far in life.
Yeah its incredibly white. And my suburb is even more white, and white liberals think they know everything there is to know about racism.
Thanks haha most of my stuff is garbage with dyslexia and ADHD
I hope they do leave, less taxpayers funding these terrible idea. College in Texas is looking better and better everyday.
Does anyone know who owns the epoch times?
About damn time Congress started looking into her anti-American actions. What took them this long?
Why do people leave their country and come here to try to make it like the country you left?
There's a group that believes this is all part of a long game strategy for an Islamic takeover.  The idea is Muslims migrate to western nations in large enough numbers that they can then start gaining positions in government using the existing western rules.  Once enough are in power they will then start to push to change the laws to be more in line with Sharia.
What's the conspiracy? She's literally doing those things.
Must be a sarcastic comment assuming the person behind it is not a retard
I don't get why Dominion gets all the attention. Wasn't Smartmatic  the one that had connections to the Venuezelan election? The track record for Trump winning an area, where Dominion was used, is actually pretty high.
You're right. Smartmatic and Dominion voting are two separate companies and Smartmatic operated in Venezuela in 2017, they pulled out after controversial practices by Venezuela's didctator
how did she not spill that
So much fun. Once upon a time I was in the 106th Army Band. I miss those days.
Something nice & sweet posted to break up the news. Thank you
Somewhere, some lefties are getting butthurt over this.
A traditional family dancing to a Marine Corps Band while smiling and celebrating Christmas.  This must be every liberal's nightmare.
Right hand on the glass. Left arm on the baby. Left arm swinging the kid. Right arm mostly stabilizing the glass.
Is that all you think about? This is a beautiful moment don't swamp it up.
Military bands are some of the most talented groups in the country. I'm not surprised when they play anything.
Press secretary dances without a mask! That would be the headline
As someone who would be labeled a liberal, or left, or whatever you wanna call me.Mother dances with child while band plays music from Frozen.Thats what it is right?The only thing that makes this post any bit political, is the fact that her title as 'White House Press Secretary' was used here.Without that, its just another lovely mother with her child, dancing along. Something I do with my kids all the time.
This is a wholesome video and the first thing you think about is Kayleigh and her husband having sex? Grow up. Learn to respect people for who they are.
For them only flute and piccolo, but while in high school and college it was the French horn for marching season, flute for concert season, and piano for jazz band.
Is the sarcasm font not clear?
Leftie here, I don't actually care.Theres no politics here.This is a mother and her child enjoying some music together.10/10 would upvote again.
there's an audition for each new spot available in military ensembles (army band, marine band, etc.) and if you win the audition you're in, you typically have to do basic training before you start though (except for the marine band)
I guess he was tired of being an actor, well let's see how you do in your next job thanks to the tolerant left.
I wonder how many celebrities out there who are secretly conservatives
This sub: "if you listen to celebrities for your politics you're a moron"Also this sub:
lefties attempt to condescend, but in reality fall far short in intellect, morality and decency compared to conservatives...they really think we don't know exactly what they're all about to say and why they say it
Reminds you a lot of Trump IMO. We need more people in our world like that. Part of what made people elect Trump, we are sick of people lying to protect their party. One of the reasons I don't get involved in politics much because you really don't know who to believe because they all lie.
If that happens then just proves his point. He's such a big name I really doubt he'd lose any acting jobs. It's all about if they can make money which he can.
Well, he is worth around 140 million....
The ones who are silent and probably don't live in California. Can't blame them for not openly saying anything.
I know Tommy Lee Jones is, and I heard somewhere that Jon Voight might be as well.
Agreed. He could be paving the path for more closet conservatives in Hollywood. Whether we like it or not they do have an impact on public political perceptions
You realize he is calling out Trump in that statement about denial and fake news right? Trump is the dude on the right denying the elction results and spreading fake news right now.  Do you even read what you type?
Hope you are right, but they can be the vindictive sorts on the left.
if they can cancel Johnny Depp they can cancel anyone.
Clint Eastwood I believe as well.
Should we tell him? I feel like we should tell him.
I mean they can but if you can't make as much money off your film going with somebody else then who are you really punishing here? Thankfully not all studios are in California.
Yeah but that's a totally different situation since she lied about him absuing her. That's a universal thing people will cancel you for.
Yeah that's what I heard. Must be pretty cool to have your college class taught by him. Isn't he also heavily invested in college football?
Damn, gun control is a big no-go for me. Otherwise, he seems like an uncommon voice of reason in hollywood.
Sorry so hypothetically if someone was charged with murder after the person was murdered its too late to be charged as the prosecution had to prove that they would murder them before they did?That makes perfect sense.
As a riverside county resident I think this man is awesome!!
Is it possible to upvote this thousands of times? I mean, dems do something similar every election year, soooo
Boo, it's not my county!  I doubt anybody up here in the Bay Area would do that.  :(recallgavin2020.com
Of course his name is Chad.

I 100% agree that the media is culpable in certain circumstances for following the "if it bleeds, it leads" mantra. This does lead to panic porn and doesn't help anyone, particularly those who are easily fooled / misled. It is known that the COVID-19 virus [does spread via asymptomatic persons, just at a lower rate](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/who-official-clarifies-misleading-position-on-asym). Just like incremental steps that save lives in other areas (e.g. wearing seatbelts in cars), those who test positive but are asymptomatic should absolutely self-isolate, as this will significantly reduce the spread of the virus. In your last sentence, you are saying that someone who is asymptomatic - who still has a greater than 50% chance of passing the illness on to someone else - should be allowed to 'continue with their life'. Would I be wrong to assume that this means that they can live life as normal, including going to events, being in close proximity with others etc? If so, that is what is already happening, and you're seeing an increase in the spread of COVID-19. Clearly something isn't working, so is it not worth just giving these measures a go, rather than pretending that the problem doesn't exist?
Good God, do your own research
Because he has single handedly helped elect dozens of DAs in big cities that refuse to prosecute any non violent crimes such as shoplifting and public camping
Also tried to collapse the entire economy of the UK at one point, on purpose.
Texas was a toss up in the election. Trump won it by 6%. When they mean toss up they mean most likely republican but I want to make Democrats not feel very bad
Yep millions of people totally went in checked Biden and then straight Rs the rest of the ticket. Yeah surrrreeeeeeeee.
How do the Republicans do this well in the HoR but lose the presidential election. Answer they didn't because the GOD DAMN DEMOCRATS ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS! lol
This makes me happy as a Californian fed up with the state of my state.
And yet somehow lost the presidency???
Yeah because no wants that socialist, elitist, and crooked crap.
Based on all the evidence that the dems DIDN'T do so well in the presidential election, ima go with what u/NoneOfUsKnowJackShit said.
Do you hear how crazy that sounds? SMH
Just remember they are a hate group.
There was found in a remote part of Maricopa county today a school bus that had been abandoned along side a road, full of voting machines. It was swarm with police and officials.
The raid took place on Nov. 5th.
The FBI has to make sure that critical evidence stays out of the hands of investigators.
I hate to say this but there were 4 who actually called for it and they need 3/5s to do this. This would then require some democrats to even get on board with it in which we all know will never happen
Identify them, name them, charge them, and hold them accountable!
Should be a felony. This is tampering with mail.
Why not just film every ballot worker the whole time?  Hardware is cheap.  Seems reasonable.
If only we had a means of investigating and dispensing justice for things like this. A department of the government, perhaps.
The amount of offended left wing individuals getting mad in here is comical. If this was a clear republican victory and all this evidence came out it would be front page news "FACIST CORRUPT DICTATOR TRUMP EMPLOYS RUSSIAN SPIES TO RIG SECOND TERM" I cant wait for this to be "fact checked" like every other blatant evidence of voter fraud and irregularity thats come out. How anyone, and i mean literally anyone can look at all the affidavits and now even camera footage and try say "this is fine" is being incredibly tribalist and disingenuous. Disgusting, like genuinely this is the kind of corruption you see in third world countrys, the elections should not be this unsafe. This must never happen again, universal mail in voting should never happen again, paper ballots only with ID on election day and miliatary ballots only. The old way is quite clearly the safest way but still you have people likr this involved with the counting. My blood boils.
Where is the FBI!?!? This is getting out of hand.
I believe them to be fucked.
I honestly didnt see the handoff
How is this right here not enough evidence for fraud?
Hold on. Can we also question why he was allowed to be there after this ridiculous behavioral display?
[Lawrence Sloan ](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/politics/election-worker-forced-into-hiding-speaks-out-video-that-falsely-claimed-he-destroyed-ballot/NF7VRBTRY5CCBH4HAARGX5SHDA/) [Ruby Freeman and Shae Moss ](https://youtu.be/xsU-CXcJ4Lg)
Seems like Uncle Sam Has Forgotten About Standard law Lately.
Holding people accountable is racist. Didnt anyone tell you?
A department of the government? You mean like some federal bureau of investigation? Impossible.
USBs are used:To load election information on to voting machines.To collect and store election results.To transport election results after polls close to the election office[source](https://www.essvote.com/blog/our-technology/truths-about-usbs-used-in-elections/)
No one knows for certain, it could be absentee ballot tabulations, a blank ballot used by Dominion for calibration, or nothing at all.
These people are so devoutly convinced that they are the good guys that they feel justified using any tactic they can to get their way, no matter how heinous.They're not feeling shame for what they've done, they're just afraid of getting caught.
It's not "sufficient to affect the result" is what they claim now when confronted with the countless examples
I believe even if ballots are incorrectly filled in they are to be kept and seperated into a reject pile.
In an interview he says he threw out the ballot instructions, which the voter had incorrectly included in the envelope along with their ballot.
Yay.The guy who sent everyone home at 10:30pm and then had vote "counting" going on in secret until 1:00am said that the video is lying to you!We should definitely believe him! Nothing to see here, guys!!!
How was it proven that it wasn't a ballot..?
Especially democrats. I'd go so far as to say it's white supremacist
Even if everything you say is true, which a lot of your bullet points are then why not just accept a signature audit? It also is incredibly suspiscious the spike in ballots for biden during this time frame the activity with the ballot boxes took place with no witnesses. As far as i know and you can correct me if im wrong of course, but is that not illegal to count ballots with nobody there to oversee those ballots? None of this even seems slightly suspicious to you? Boarding up windows, thousands of sworn affidavits of republican poll watchers being intimidated and removed from counting stations. I just cant understand how anyone can be willing to just roll over so easilly after 4 years of russiagate. The least that is owed is signature auditing under these circumstances and a full forensic investigation of ballot machines. If you think biden so easilly got 80 million votes without cheating then there should be no problem with any checks if its legitimate. Lets remember hillary clintons wise words to joe biden not to concede under any circumstances, might he the smartest thing that woman has ever said.Its also worth mentioning and i wanted to know what exactly "trumps unfavourables" are? Anyone who supports president trump is not unfavourable, they are infact patriots. Anyone supporting president trump can see he loves his country and is fighting for their rights and liberty, and the people responsible for interfering with this election and turning a blind eye should be held accountable, i dont care what party they are from. There is clearly still lots to drain from the swamp.
Irregardless, no one who is conducting legitimate lawful business hands off a USB flash drive in a manner not entirely different than moving contraband in a prison mess hall.
Wow. I wasnt looking at that. I thought it was between the guy standing up, and the lady. Damn thats legit
She looks directly at the camera too cause she knows it's there, classic guilty conscious thing to do.
Their end justifies the means, simple as that.
>Or more likely how frustratingly stupid the average person is, and by somehow failing to properly fill out ballot after ballot, and then claiming their ballots were 'tossed', only to then turn the blame on a video with no context shared on social media 'proving' the election was 'stolen' because someone threw a piece of paper emotionally.>This is laughable and desperate.What's laughable is you're equally speculative
Gotcha that makes sense. Not too educated on the process.
What would he give that the middle finger? Makes no sense.
Cake day truth bomb right there.
It was between 3 people. The first lady to the second lady, the second lady to the guy standing up.
Somewhere in the comments below there is a link posted showing a slow-mo clip with some zoom in of the handoff. I watched the one above a few times and still couldn't quite tell what I was watching. But the slowed down clip that zooms in, shows what is 99% a flash drive. He hands it to the chick on his left, who then sends it across the desk to the chick on his right. It zooms in when the second woman is reaching for it.I'm all for playing Devils Advocate whenever possible. But like I said, rational thought tells us that what is shown in the video is not indicative of legitimate business being conducted. Devils Advocate comes into play more in the earlier part where he was crumpling and discarding some piece of paper.
I really wish i had good photoshop skills. The infamous video of the USB handoff in georgia and their floppy disk hand off were so similar itd be hilarious
And so it begins. One small step closer to being chipped and monitored like cattle.
Well, just give them a chance to make some up,  geez
Without chain of custody, votes are not valid
37 Trump votes used in the equal sample run had been "Switched" from Trump to Biden. In actual algorithmic terms this means that a vote for Trump was counted as 87% of a vote and a vote for Biden was counted as 113% of a vote.Those conducting the test were so shocked that they ran the same ballots again. The same results appeared. ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SOLVED. (It is worth noting that this was one County, and on one Tabulator alone.Dominion Tabulators could have been configured with different algorithms in different Counties or States.) The point is there is now hard evidence of electronic manipulation of the Election.The use of illegal and/or fabricated ballots is an additional issue altogether, but this is sufficient evidence to question the validity of the ENTIRE Election in the 28 states that used Dominion software.

And BOOM goes the dynamite. Thank you, and goodnight.
Want more investigation and more sources..
Why doesn't 60 minutes pick this story up?  I mean seriously, this would be really good investigative journalism... Hopefully NewsMax at least does.
I wish there was some actual evidence.  Or are least a video with the machine in question which can be verified as from today's date.
Still waiting for actual proof. A Twitter post by some random guy is not proof. Where is the news conference with county officials or press release from said officials? I suppose it doesn't exist because <insert evil guy/org name> is hiding it, or it will be released on the 12th of never.
I'm out of the loop on these details. Who is conducting the test? On behalf of who? Who is Robb Hurst? Where can I learn more about this?
Also explains why democrats wanted to wipe the machines so bad.
News max will but keep in mind news maxx is not a news organization. Their CEO came out a week or so ago and said that many of their broadcasts are opinion pieces and can not be reasonably considered news and that people are entitled to their opinion. [https://www.newsweek.com/newsmax-chris-ruddy-election-fraud-interview-1550105](https://www.newsweek.com/newsmax-chris-ruddy-election-fraud-interview-1550105)
the guy in the video says that hes read the deposition and that he's testifying today? So potentially we will have more details from that?
I call BS on your BS.  Easy to just brush things off.  Have you considered its actually facts? Then what?  Keep your mind open.  It's completely possible it was all rigged.
Liberals get 98% of reddit. r/conservative and r/republican are our only places where this won't get censored and/or taken down. We try to spread our ideas to everyone, but conservatives are demonized and censored. This happens regularly. You probably wouldn't know, since your media censors it before you know it exists.
Twitter is supposed to be a 'platform' and it won't even let people post this information. Yet you expect openly left-wing subs to let it stay up?
If you assholes really thought Russia fraudulently stole 2016, wouldn't you have armed yourselves and overthrown the gov, instead of just LARPing a socialist revolution and burning down small businesses?Unlike you, violence is a last resort for us. Rule of law precedes our own wishes. The constitution protects the minority from the will of the majority. Losing Trump is a win for us, but the next for years allows all of the repub run states to discover and eliminate the causes of fraud and possible exploitable weaknesses in our system.
Sorry. The lot of us must have had work this week.
You think we go full retard like BLM or something? Nah, you got the wrong ones. Trump "lost" how many cities burned? Now, if Biden somehow snakes his way into the oval office... i think you'll see a different side of the patriots.
No country is completely free. Having served in the military and visiting other countries we have it far better than most. Does the government encroach on our freedoms from time to time, yes, but not in the way that other countries do. You may get a fine here for stepping out of the intended boundaries as where in multiple other countries it could be a death sentence or harsh punishment. I think the majority of America does not realize how well we have it here.
Preach! Louder with Crowder had some awesome segments and sources. It's a place to start! R/louderwithcrowder
If there was fraud, it is more than "a little thing". Is this not a binary concern? We got fucked or we didn't. How does your asshole feel? Mine stings. Let it play out in the courts.
Anyone have the link or a source on this ?
Except we never actually flattened the curve..
We (in Cali) are being forced back into "Stay at home orders":They are closing dinning, bars, gyms, salons...etc..but guess what is exempt?protests....protests... protests...Makes you wonder what in the heck they are thinking?We are under this for 3 weeks.... :(
270000 dead Americans and people still refuse to wear a mask for 15 minutes at Costco. Greatest generation right here folks
That may be true. He sure isn't doing his job.
Report them as you see them please.
Even in this thread there are people trying to accept the loss. How weak do you have to be to just take what you are handed when you know it's wrong? Have some balls and use logic. If all arrows point to fraud then it is likely fraud. What compels you to just open your mouth to accept that load? This is American. The last stand between a world controlled by trillionaire globalists. Let them take this election and enjoy the fall of capitalism and freedom.
So silence is violence and now questioning them is poisoning democracy? Sounds like they just want total unquestioned power but we knew that already didnt we?
This charge of "without evidence" is BS.  I am so sick of them trying to gaslight the people on this.  Sorry sworn affidavits are the very definition of evidence you fuck wads.
If it leads to fair elections, his tactics **should** have staying power.
Hi european here.I am trying to understand: if there is so much evidence available by the president why didn't he show it in court? Why didnt he let those weird poeple testify in court under oath instead of a public hearing without any consequences. Also that weird press conference, why didn't the president show those evidences to a real judge instead of only on youtube?I mean if I read correctly all earlier cases were thrown out because the evidence was outragesly weak. How do you republicams view this? I mean if you have the evidence why not show it in court instead of only on the internet.
I'm really sorry, is that supposed to be a noose, or is this a joke about Slipknot?
Also following this from the other side of the ocean. Although I'm explicitly trying to balance right wing and left wing media, I must say it's very hard to get convinced of fraud having taken place. Is this subreddit mostly convinced of this fact, and if so, based on what other than hope/disappointment?
So was bubbas garage pull down
I did and if im not mistaken all judges in all regions (counties?) dismissed the casses and said there was no sufficient evidence. Also his lawyer Rudy I believe said in court "there is no fraud" as lying to a judge would get him in trouble.
I am sorry I don't understand.So he has the lets say a video of wide spread voter fraud which would give him the clear victory but he does not show it for months?Also isn't the election result final in december in America, so if he would wait with providing evidence he losses his shot?
Right, what I figured. Just wanted to make sure.
It was not a noose. Its a bowline knot. Obviously you have not worked in a shop before. It was wallace and his crew who reported a "hate crime" even though the know was in a picture of a different crew in the stall from atleast 2018. Drivers are not told what stall they are in untill the week of. Its being petty, and thats all that bubba does
It is hurting urban and low income areas HARD. It is hard enough to get children to attend physical school in these areas let alone get them to show for online. Even in my childs school (suburban school) attendance is horrible for online and one on one support is almost impossible. The teachers are making efforts but the entire remote learning scenario just doesn't work for a lot of children. If schools can allow sports to continue then physical school should continue.
