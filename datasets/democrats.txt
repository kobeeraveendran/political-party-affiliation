This lady took the exact same tactic as Trump in the first debate. Talk over everyone and make ridiculous accusations that throw people off because of how absurd it all is."The numbers aren't off by 30,000""Why, because your army of gnomes came in at night and fiddled with all the equipment?"*dumbfounded look*"Yeah, that's it isn't it, you have no response"
Why is healthcare such a hot topic in America?Basic healthcare is covered in Australia for anyone who pays the Medicare levy (anyone who pays taxes), so other than the small (like really small) tax for medicare, healthcare is free.
It would be a good thing, but no idea how it will ever get through.
Capitalism and health and drug companies own the politicians.
Bernies the best.See how he lost to Biden and not even by much or fairly and he did that after a friekn heart attack...But he never once contested the result and has 100% supported Biden as he did Hillary.   This is how a decent true American and democrat behaves.
America, especially rural areas that are primarily conservative is so rooted in individualism that people aren't willing to pay more taxes because they view it as the government taking their money and using it to pay for other peoples Healthcare. They just don't understand that it would also pay for their own Healthcare.
Racism. Racist white people would rather not get social services than let black people get them. See the welfare queens hysteria.
It will get through when there's no Moscow Mitch
Universal Healthcare =/= M4A&#x200B;when will people learn this&#x200B;M4A is the furthest left healthcare policy in the western world. It bans private insurance in its entirety including in dental. No other developed country does that.
You conveniently forgot that the man who did run on that lost spectacularly by 9 million votes
That is indeed correct, but is a global problem not linked to countries providing public healthcare. But it means that I dont get a 500k Bill for a fucking hospital stay that I have to cover myself. Also insurance companies will lie, beg and throw the mother of all hissy fits to avoid paying shit and things like deductibles and spending maximums exist so even if you are insured it does not mean you are out of the woods( I had that explained to me, correct if wrong). I pay 55 Euroes a month and my employer pays about the same and I never have to worry about any bills, and even if I cant pay my insurance (bankruptcy   for example) I will still get every treatment and procedure I need and dont worry about a hospital bill worsening my finacial situation even more.
Which is a different and *separate* problem from the one pointed out by Sanders. The US had that same problem and ***ALSO*** (I'm going to repeat that word because it's important): ***ALSO*** the problem created by people not having health insurance. That's an ***additional*** problem unique to America.What does it mean?1. It means people go broke / bankrupt and spend the rest of their lives working as wage slaves to pay off medical debt. 2. It means some people would rather risk dying than being wage slaves so they risk not going to the doctor, and end up dying of COVID when there's still a good chance they could have been saved with medical intervention.3. \#2, but also OTHER conditions and ailments other than just COVID. People who lose insurance can't afford cancer treatments or other crucial medical care or prescriptions like heart medication, and end up dying as a result of it.
Also that they already pay for other people's healthcare cause that's how private insurance works
This is not true. A good many Democrats and all republicans would oppose Bernies M4A plan.
What makes you think they forgot?
Seriously, whenever you encounter this situation just ask them what they think insurance does
Republicans know teaching critical thinking leads to more dems lmao
Why do you think Republicans are constantly shitting on Universities and higher education?
The fact that they think M4A is a winning strategy
They know, which is why they were so fervently against the individual mandate of the ACA. They viewed it as just another tax.Most of the people who don't want nationalized healthcare would also deliberately choose to not have insurance at all. "I ain't sick so why should I pay for healthcare?"It's an inherently selfish, self-centered point of view. It's also short-sighted. It's like saying "I ain't retired yet, so why should I have to save for retirement?" or "I ain't crashed the car yet, so why should have to put on my seatbelt?"
Ummm.... Literally every dem candidate ran on universal healthcare.
They still have access to private healthcare. NHS is specifically for public healthcare.
It's you putting your personal liberties over the taxpayer's best interests. If you get appendicitis and go to the ER and don't have insurance they are still going to save your life whether you can afford to pay the bill or not. So your just pushing the cost on to everyone else when you can't afford your 30k bill.
Maybe Texas will do us all a favor and secede.
Bold of you to assume there is any thinking involved in the process
It's the memorial that sits over the battleship Arizona. Parts of it sit above the waterline and it still leaks oil. Quite moving to see it knowing that many souls still rest there!
So he tweeted about winning the election this morning and then shared this link without comment:https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-national-pearl-harbor-remembrance-day-2020/What gets me is the last two paragraphs have him "proclaiming" this the remembrance day, when it was actually passed under the Clinton administration.https://uslaw.link/citation/us-law/public/103/308Their deceit knows no bounds.
tRumps fucked attitude is...." what's in it for them?" He's a yuge pile of shit.
I have visited this hallowed place, it moved me in ways i didn't expect. Thanks for your service is just not enough to describe the sacrifice this solemn place reminds we visitors of.
I don't know what that is either...what is it?
I remember learning what this was from an episode of the Brady Bunch.
He and his followers are idiots.
It read that in his disgusting, sniveling voice.
I hereby nominate Louisiana Purchase to fill her seat immediately. I call on the senate to confirm her without bias.
The Pearl Harbor memorial in Hawaii
Pretty stupid for someone his age and position!
Yes. In fact some survivors have since had their remains interred there as well.
That should be a testament to anyone feeling ambivalent about the final resting place at USS Arizona. I took this tour a few times. It's upsetting in key moments, and there's a certain amount of what might be considered propaganda on site which to aid in that, but it focused on the factual history and it didn't have any illegitimate basis or biased political appeal that I'm aware of. To this day, bubbles still rise from the structure beneath, and it's mentioned in the tour, though it's left to the imagination as to why that might be.
It would have been difficult to remove them with respect and this way they are considered buried at sea. Not sure what benefit that is though. There are still sailors on the USS Utah also. Funny, I'm more interested in US history now then I was in school.
When some WWII vets died, they asked to be returned to the Arizona.  So their ashes were put down there.  https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/12/06/pearl-harbor-vets-interment-to-be-last-on-sunken-arizona/Also, they did try to raise the Arizona to remove the bodies but it didn't work so they left them there and considered them buried at sea.
Idk, didn't we all think this was the case in 08? Don't jinx it!
With Fox News, OANN, Breitbart, Townhall, and Newsmax, etc., the GOP isn't going anywhere.  If anything the Republicans picked up seats in the House in November, and history says they'll pick up more seats in 2022.  The only way Democrats defend or defeat the GOP is to speak the truth and have a zero tolerance policy for Republican's fabricated reality.
The GOP as it is now was born from the rise of the Tea Party, I think around 2009. Though maybe you can take it as far back as Sarah Palin, when the GOP blamed the media for her bumbling ineptitude and then celebrated ignorance as virtuous.Before that, even when they were wrong, I don't recall them celebrating it. They at least tried to argue that they weren't wrong, as if being wrong was not something they wanted to be. That's still bad, but it's different from being proud of being wrong and arguing that that makes them right because their small town values are virtuous and make them truly right, or because being told by experts that they're wrong is persecution that makes them virtuous and exposes their rightness in the face of elitists knowing things.(The Tea Party's rise is also when I started to notice wider reporting of the conspiracy theories Republicans believed, and realized that it wasn't just a handful of my friends who believed people like Alex Jones.)Fun fact: In a 2012 Gallup Poll, Trump tied with Huckabee as Republicans' top pick for the GOP's presidential nominee.[https://news.gallup.com/poll/147233/huckabee-trump-romney-pace-gop-field-2012.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/147233/huckabee-trump-romney-pace-gop-field-2012.aspx)
Nah. The old Republican Party is dead. The new Republican Party of extremism and authoritarianism is alive and well
He didn't kill it, he just showed its true colors.
Trump had always been a piece of shit. And everyone knew that voting for him in 2016. And over 70 million people still know that today and voted for him yet again. He represents a large number of Americans i guess. Its disgusting.
If we charged a nickel after this guy dies to piss on his grave we could pay off the national debt...and then I'd let someone else have a turn.
Kind of? The Arizona official GOP is tweeting out direct calls for violence against democrats. There are plenty of them calling for mass slaughter. The problem is that they make of a very small portion of the population, and the produce/control very little resources. Blue counties produce over 70% of America's GDP. They are worthless terrorists that can cause marginal damage. They should be ran out of every office and state. They are openly seditious and should be punished severely.I think what your describing is possible, but extremely unlikely. I also think they question should be more about what kind of punishment they should receive for being openly seditious.
I don't care what anybody says, she would've made a good president.
I wonder where he is planning on building his presidential library...
What a complete cunt that man is. He accomplished zero policy changes, and his inaction led to the highest loss of American lives than any other crisis.
Yes, silly putty would probably be the proper medium.
Sc and In were never gonna go blue
The odds of this happening were the same as Trump winning the popular vote.
Thanks for posting this - AND  Kelly Loeffler and Raphael Warnock at **7 p.m.** [**https://www.gpb.org**](https://www.gpb.org)
My wife said Loeffler just kept saying.."the Democrats will raise your taxes." She doesn't seem smart.
Do you think this is good for Ossoff to do solo?    The mods seem like they are somewhat defensive of Perdue.
The Georgia Democratic Party is selling Warnock/Ossoff yard signs and raising money to help them win! [https://store.georgiademocrat.org/warnock-ossoff-for-senate-24-x-18-coroplast-yard-sign/](https://store.georgiademocrat.org/warnock-ossoff-for-senate-24-x-18-coroplast-yard-sign/)
Perdue actually performs much better if he doesn't show.  Also, he gets to avoid questions about his stock trading.
*'Out of an abundance of caution to avoid catching the Hoax China Virus, I will be away tonight, owning the Libs from a distance.' - Perdue, probably.PS: "Perdue"  means "LOST" in French.  Pass the freedom fries.
Perdue the chicken shit hawk. Lol
Purdue , the yellow belly coward.
And sadly there will still be plenty that vow for Perdue. It makes no sense to me
And with the way the Republican tax bill is structured it will appear that the Democrats are raising taxes. The hikes in middle and lower class taxes dont take effect until after Biden will be sworn in.
She is a little confused. The Democrats will raise *her* taxes.The vast majority of Georgians will not have their taxes raised
Yeah I think it's good it makes Perdue look like an entitled pussy.
Ossoff gets tons of free media and could take whatever shots at Perdue he wants.  It's all upside for Ossoff.
Sorry it's finished now. Warnock/Loeffler debate live on CNN at 7 Eastern though.Edit: found link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITdivfZM0zE
Single issues voters (guns, abortions, immigrants, you name it) and fundies.
I'm deaf and can read lips. She looked like she was wearing an earpiece and repeating whatever words were told to her. That's why she seemed robotic. And frozen. Earpiece. Wire.
Oh I'm sure the Trumptards will think of something.
Oh my god they introduced the empty podium like everything was totally normal! That's fucking hilarious
Thanks! Wow less than 30 minutes?
Haters, mostly.  Want to control and punish women, blame immigrants for their own failures, and have the ability to kill people.  Same with fundies.
Realistically they are not your target audience.  They aren't voting for him even if the Virgin Mary was his mom.
Yes, haters. I'll never forget some people who had voted for Trump in 2016 saying they weren't going to this time around because....He's hurting the wrong people! Think about that.
Well of course not, she would be a minority and teen age mom....they would be casting stones or locking her up.
I think it would have been fair to give Ossoff the full time since Perdue is the one who backed out.
Actually I think they should have still given Perdue his time, camera on his podium for every question.
Leopards eating faces all over the place!
Nothing but voter fraud in all of those states, especially Michigan.  A Democrat winning in the Detroit area?  C'mon now!And then there's that darn fictional Edison County.
Should go MI/WIS first, then PA, then AZ, then GA
The only thing I like better than winning all these swing states was trump paying for us to win them all again
"If you don't count all the blue states, I would have won!"-Some orange idk
Cmon guys do some research.howbidenstoletheelection.com
idk, but i hope that PA stays blue
I really don't understand how 74 million Americans including my brother don't see this.
I respect the fact that my brother in law voted for trump was a big supporter of him but now says he lost fair and square stop the lying get out and lets move on
I was wondering the exact same thing
They see it. They like the hate whether or not they will admit it.
No 2nd-time Trump voter deserves respect.
ok, probably much better considering we don't have a selfish idiot in the White House come January.  Trump got played by every dictator in the world.  Remember when Trump gave up our S. Korean military operations and in return N. Korea gave him nothing?  How fucking stupid do you have to be to be the one superpower in the world and lose a negotiation to a tiny tinpot dictatorship that can't even feed its own people?
My friends that voted Trump did it because they care more about economics then enviroment, green energy and proper covid lockdowns, and they think Trump is better in terms of economy then Biden. That's what my Trump voting friends say, I don't.
Lol Trump took away my rights fuck off with this free country bullshit.   That man gives two fucks about a free country.
Actually the trumpettes who refuse to live by the constitution and democracy need to find a new home if they find living in the United States of America intolerable.
Way to reframe the actual point.I think we're all perfectly happy to have disagreements, but different realities? Not so much, and when you threaten what someone considers their reality, they generally don't just shrug it off.The latest demonstration is Trump wanting the names of the 25 Republicans who acknowledged his loss.  I'm sure it's just to send them a nice note and not to make them targets of his supporters.
Fuck off fascist...fake ass patriot. Don't be waving those american flags when ur fat ugly daddy is opposing the democratic process, the most american thing about our country. How does trump's penis taste again?
>fake patriots like the ones crying to the sky when the president they dont like gets elected? man what a hilarious time that wasyes indeed it was! those damn trump supporters just whining and crying and lashing out that Biden won? what a sight. ;)
That last claim was very bold of him
Even worse, this is the second time he has done it. After he got called out during the general election cycle, he skipped the final debate. He knows the pressure will be on him over his COVID trading.
Perdue doesn't want to further incriminate himself over his (and Billionaire Loeffler's) insider trading before Americans were told how bad COVID is
I thought gaetz got it too
Herman Cain should be center square.
Ivanka will get you double bingo!
You are right, DUI guy had it in Nov:https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/07/covid-19-matt-gaetz-tests-positive-coronavirus-antibodies/6202324002/
You mean before Biden can fire him?
I feel like the term "leftist" has pretty much lost all meaning and is basically a catch-all for anyone a Republican disagrees with. Just my opinion though...
Not gonna watch, but he needs to not be a pussy bitch and attack her for being in the 1% and can't fathom what it's like for real Georgians.
He did a decent job.  I think he could have been tougher. There is the issue of a Black man attacking a White woman. It is Georgia, after all.
Well should keep him out of the courts which Is great news, at least 14 days.
No! Without him they might actually win a case!
Please....give Biden the tools he needs.
Well if Republicans boycott the election, the dems have an easy shot at winning
They were never really your friends if you lost them so easily.
Jokes on those friends I unfriended them early one once I realized they intended on voting for the worst president in US history.
That's why everybody should encourage their state legislators to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compacthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact?wprov=sfla1
Trump is a desperate, cornered man. Whatever he's afraid of, he obviously knows it's going to be bad.
as a private/public citizen, he will be open for lawsuits and being arrested...
A pretty accurate indicator of how many actual "conservatives" are left in the GOP who have not been radicalized by Trump into anti-democracy, anti-Constitution cultists at his beck and call.
....I don't get this sentiment. Republicans have never cared about the constitution...or states rights...or shrinking the deficit...or law and order.They care about power and exerting that power to gain more power. I think my point is that this behavior is not surprising at all.
