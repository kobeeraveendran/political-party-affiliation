# Political Party Affiliation using Modern Natural Language Processing

## Motivation

This project is based on a similar work I encountered in the MachineLearning subreddit. That work attempts to predict the political alignment of a Reddit user by taking their active subreddits as input features to a logistic regression model. The outputs are labels drawn from another subreddit, `r/PoliticalCompassMemes`, in which user flairs serve as labels denoting their specific political leaning.
